                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

The JSON response provided is complete and contains suggestions and tags for each round of dialogue you provided. Since the sequence ended at round 9 with "speaker A: And they're like. They're.", there isn't a continuation to provide further.

However, if you have more dialogue that you'd like to be reviewed, please feel free to include it and I'll be happy to continue providing suggestions and tags for additional rounds of conversation.

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

**User:** `continue`

**Assistant**:
Apologies, but it seems there's a misunderstanding. The last statement from speaker A appears incomplete and lacks a response from speaker B. If this is an error and there is more to the conversation, please provide the additional dialogue so I can continue to provide the necessary suggestions and tags. If this was the end of the conversation, then it is already correctly formatted in the last JSON instance as there is nothing to correct or suggest for speaker B.

So for me, I like people, but I also need time by myself.", 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: A real extrovert just wants people all the time. They just like people. People. That's too much for me.", 'speaker B: Have you heard of the chinese tosa culture before? By Chinese? No.', "speaker A: But it's a common in the west for even someone's birthday or when someone gets married, you propose a toast. Propose a toast. And you all stand up and you have alcohol in your glass. And you say in a marriage to Jane and Peter. And then everyone says, jane and Peter. And then they. So you don't have to say much. You just to Jane and Peter. And you drink and then you sit down. Okay. Okay. So tell me, do you have brothers and sisters?", "speaker B: I'm the only child of my parents. Yeah. So I think this situation puts a lot pressure on me.", "speaker A: Because your parents put everything, all their hopes and dreams in you, and you must perform and do well notes. It's really hard. And then there's no one to talk to. Like, if your parents are being unreasonable or you think they're putting too much pressure. If you have a brother and sister, you can talk about it, but there's no one to talk to. It's just you and the pressure. Yeah. And I understand that. And then when they get old, it falls on you to care for them.", "speaker B: Thank you. I think today the time it's. Applaud.", 'speaker A: It was so nice meeting you. Really lovely.

                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"Suggestion": {"title": "Suggestion", "description": "\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u6807\u8bb0", "type": "array", "items": {"$ref": "#/definitions/Revision"}}}, "required": ["Suggestion"], "definitions": {"Revision": {"title": "Revision", "type": "object", "properties": {"Round": {"title": "Round", "description": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6570", "type": "string"}, "speaker_A": {"title": "Speaker A", "description": "speaker A \u7684\u539f\u8868\u8fbe", "type": "string"}, "speaker_B": {"title": "Speaker B", "description": "speaker B \u7684\u539f\u8868\u8fbe", "type": "string"}, "authentic_expression": {"title": "Authentic Expression", "description": "\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684authentic expression", "type": "string"}, "tags": {"title": "Tags", "description": "{\n                                            CORRECT\n                                            POLITENESS_USAGE \n                                            SENTENCE_STRUCTURE_ERROR \n                                            WORD_USAGE_ERROR \n                                            SENTENCE_SEQUENCE_ERROR\n                                            TENSE_ERROR\n                                            VOICE_ERROR\n                                            MODAL_VERB_ERROR \n                                            PRONOUN_AGREEMENT_ERROR \n                                            GRAMMAR\n                                            VOCABULARY\n                                            CLARITY_AND_FLUENCY\n                                        }\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u8005\u591a\u4e2a", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["Round", "speaker_A", "speaker_B", "authentic_expression", "tags"]}}}

I would never have guessed you were an introvert.", 'speaker B: Not at all.', "speaker A: You come across as very friendly. Okay. But I can see, as an archaeologist, if you're an introvert, it's a nice job because you're just by yourself. It's not having to talk to people all the time. So I can see as an introvert that archaeology.", "speaker B: Actually, I don't think so. Because in my country. In my country, the Chinese toast culture. Do you know the meaning? I can tap you. I just learned the word several days ago.", 'speaker A: Chinese coast culture, okay.', "speaker B: Is very popular in my country.

Yes.", "speaker A: You can type in Chinese, too, because I've got the translation thing on.", "speaker B: Yeah. I don't know how to say. For example, I went to excavation field several years ago, but the teacher in the excavation asked me to drink the alcohol.", "speaker A: Yeah, that's right. And you had to propose a toast. You had to propose PR. Oppose the toast. Cheers, everyone.", "speaker B: Yeah. This is what I want to say, but actually, I don't like. I don't like it.", "speaker A: No, I can understand that I wouldn't like it either. You are having to speak in public. Lots of people do not like that. Do not like that. But they are not introverts. Lots of people don't like speaking in public.

I'm more extrovert. I'm more extrovert. I am more extrovert than introvert. But I'm not a big introvert. I like people. I love people. But I also need to have time on my own. There's a mixture. And maybe this is what you are. Ambiv. An ambivale. M-B-I-V-E. Amyvert is half extrovert, half introvert. Middle. Yeah, you sort of middle. So for me, I like people, but I also need time by myself.", 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: A real extrovert just wants people all the time. They just like people. People. That's too much for me.", 'speaker B: Have you heard of the chinese tosa culture before? By Chinese? No.', "speaker A: But it's a common in the west for even someone's birthday or when someone gets married, you propose a toast. Propose a toast. And you all stand up and you have alcohol in your glass. And you say in a marriage to Jane and Peter. And then everyone says, jane and Peter. And then they. So you don't have to say much. You just to Jane and Peter. And you drink and then you sit down. Okay. Okay. So tell me, do you have brothers and sisters?", "speaker B: I'm the only child of my parents. Yeah. So I think this situation puts a lot pressure on me.", "speaker A: Because your parents put everything, all their hopes and dreams in you, and you must perform and do well notes. It's really hard. And then there's no one to talk to. Like, if your parents are being unreasonable or you think they're putting too much pressure. If you have a brother and sister, you can talk about it, but there's no one to talk to. It's just you and the pressure. Yeah. And I understand that. And then when they get old, it falls on you to care for them.", "speaker B: Thank you. I think today the time it's. Applaud.", 'speaker A: It was so nice meeting you. Really lovely. And as I say, I love your cap. I think it is so nice.', 'speaker B: Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Bye.', 'speaker A: Bye.', 'speaker B: Bye. Cheers.']`

Do you like them?', 'speaker B: Yeah, I like it especially.', 'speaker A: They taste so good.', 'speaker B: When I was younger, I really like.', "speaker A: Okay, yeah, when you were younger? We have a lot of nuts in the US. I'm assuming you guys do as well. But I feel like that's a really good snack. It's like protein, but I will say they're not like. I feel like I like pistachios, but I'm never excited to go get nuts and eat them. It's kind of like, oh, it's healthy if I'm a little hungry, but I'm never excited to go get them.", 'speaker B: Really?', 'speaker A: Yeah.', "speaker B: No, where I began, it is not. I can't stop.", "speaker A: Really? Well, all right. Nice. That's good. What about olives? Do you ever eat olives?", "speaker B: Olives? We don't hate olives.", "speaker A: Olives are really good.

You don't say shanghu.", 'speaker B: Mogul is general name.', 'speaker A: What is Shanghu then? Shanghu is not kind of mogul. It is.', 'speaker B: I thought it was two kinds, but they are all.', "speaker A: Okay. Yeah, they're all goo. They're just all. Yeah, but, yes, that's what I'm talking correct.", 'speaker B: Correct.', "speaker A: And people just in the US, I guess right now it's a little bit trendy because people are starting to realize how healthy mushrooms are and so people are starting to eat them more because people are starting to realize how good they are for you.", "speaker B: Actually, I like dish. It's fried mushroom.", "speaker A: What's it called?", 'speaker B: Jamungu.', 'speaker A: Jamunku. One of my favorite.', 'speaker B: Fried. Fried. Yeah, fried mushroom.', "speaker A: But it's mushroom. Is it the small white mushrooms? Yeah, I know what you're talking about. Yeah, that's good. I think one of my favorite mushrooms is Hotogu.

Maybe it's toxic.", "speaker A: The colorful ones, yeah, but I don't go find mushrooms for myself. Do you go look for mushrooms? I just buy them from the store.", 'speaker B: No, but a province in China called. Yeah, there are a lot of kinds of mushrooms.', 'speaker A: Cool.', 'speaker B: The local people really like it.', "speaker A: That's cool.", 'speaker B: But some are toxic. When you. Deadly, like, deadly, you will have some illusions.', "speaker A: Okay, hold on. This is a big topic. So first of all, people go, literally, they call it mushroom hunting in the US. Like they look for mushrooms. People love to go look for mushrooms in the US. We have mushrooms here too. And it's true. Some of them are like, you can eat them and they're like toxic, like deadly. Like you can actually die from eating them. Like they're really bad for you. But some of them, and we usually call these shrooms, they're hallucinogenic. How do I spell that? I have to figure out how to spell this. Okay, hallucinogenic, which means that you can kind of see things that aren't there. And it's like a drug, like you said. Like a drug. Oh, shoot. Keep talking. My laptop is going to die. I'm getting my charger. But keep talking. I can hear you. These mushrooms are like, people take them for fun. Probably not in China, but in here people take them for fun.", 'speaker B: Like take drugs.', "speaker A: You know what I mean? Yeah, like taking a job. You don't do that. Is it expensive? It's more expensive than just like, the mushrooms you eat. But I don't think so. They're not like crazy expensive. I have had them before and they're fine. It's kind of can. It's not bad, but I can imagine. I bet in China people find these from the forest who go out and look for them. And some people don't want them but I bet some people in China do want them. And then they found them in the forest so they don't have to tell anyone and they can just take them. That's sick. Okay. Sorry. I didn't know my laptop was low on battery. But, yeah, we call those shrooms. We call those. Shrooms is like a. No, shrooms is like the drug. Yeah, but mushroom is like the food. So if you find one that's hallucinogenic. I know that's a long word, hallucinogenic. Then we call those shrooms. And so people dry them. They make them dry, and then they eat them because they want to have an experience. Really? That's funny, though. That's funny. But I was very shocked by how many mushrooms they eat in Taiwan because we don't have that. People don't usually eat that many different types of mushrooms in the US. In Taiwan, they have so many different types of mushrooms. Like, in Taiwan, it was my first time ever having the hotoku. I never had that before. And now I love. Good. So good. I was going to say, I think in Taiwan, the reason why I ate it so much is because a lot of the vegetarian food has mushrooms in it instead of meat. It's a lot of mushrooms instead of meat.", 'speaker B: Yeah. In Beijing, there are some vegetarian restaurants and they have many normal dishes having the same name with non vegetarian food, but the elements are vegetable.', 'speaker A: Totally. I love a restaurant like that. I prefer that. Yeah.', 'speaker B: Mushroom can fake as meat with special cooking.', "speaker A: Right, exactly. It's like a specific way that they prepare it. But I don't really need it to taste like meat because I don't really like meat that much. But sometimes they can make a burger out of the mushroom, kind of like a burger kind of thing. And that's pretty call. I forget what they call it, this type of mushroom meat in Taiwan, but it's good. Have you had it before.", 'speaker B: Burg, outside of a mushroom?', 'speaker A: No, just like. Just like the vegetarian kind of meat.', "speaker B: I don't know.", "speaker A: Probably not. But in Taiwan, they have a lot of vegetarian restaurants because they're buddhist restaurants. Do you have that in China? Like vegetarian buddhist restaurants?", "speaker B: I haven't seen.", "speaker A: Oh, you haven't seen it?", 'speaker B: Yeah. The Buddhism is so rare now.', "speaker A: Oh, okay. Yeah, that makes sense. I have another student who lives in Beijing, and she's maybe, but I don't think she eats, like, at buddhist restaurants or anything.", 'speaker B: Is she in the temple?', "speaker A: I don't think so. But she says she's a Buddhist. She's not from Beijing, but she lives there now.", 'speaker B: Okay.', "speaker A: Yeah, I think she's from Chichang or something. But anyway, she was talking to me about how her memories from child. She has a lot of memories from childhood. Of her grandpa making dojiang soy milk in the yotiao, I don't think. We don't really have an english way to say yo tiao. We just say yo tiao. There's no english word for that. Yeah, fried dough. Exactly. Totally fried Dough. So, fried dough in the soy milk. He used to make it in the morning and people would come buy it. So I was wondering. Do you have. What's your childhood memory for breakfast?", 'speaker B: Yeah. Utah.', 'speaker A: That one.', "speaker B: It was impressed that in primary school one day I ate eight stripes of Utah. It's glossy.", "speaker A: Yeah. It has a lot of air in it. Right? It's like a sponge. What do you call the suqua? The suqua sponge that you clean yourself with.", "speaker B: I don't know.", "speaker A: You don't know what I'm talking about? They have these all over Asia. It looks like sukua. Like the loofah. Okay, I'm going to show you. Like this. This plant is called sukwa. You call it sukua, right?", "speaker B: Yeah, but I don't know what's a relation. Sugua.", 'speaker A: It looks like. It looks like yotiao.', 'speaker B: It looks like Yotiao is singer or tuha shidomoto.', "speaker A: You mean. It's like. This is lufa. This is the sukwa.", "speaker B: I know, Sukwa. But it's seeker than.", "speaker A: I know, I know. But I'm saying that like sukwa. It has the air in it like holes. Yokiao is not solid. It's not solid?", "speaker B: Yeah. After eating them, they're so glossy. They were so glossy.", 'speaker A: Oily.', 'speaker B: Yeah. I felt.', 'speaker A: Nauseous.', 'speaker B: Real.', "speaker A: Yeah, that's nauseous.", 'speaker B: Nauseous. Yeah, about it.', 'speaker A: So do you eat yotiao now or you cannot eat it anymore? Like, did you get so sick that you never wanted to eat it again?', "speaker B: Or do you still eat it the next time? I still would eat it, but in middle school, my canteen didn't provide the utah. I don't know why.", 'speaker A: So what did you have?', 'speaker B: Like, beans. Bean.', 'speaker A: Beans.', 'speaker B: Cake.', 'speaker A: Egg cake. Cake?', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: No, there's no way you had cake for breakfast. Duncau bean.", 'speaker B: Actually.', 'speaker A: Can. How can this translate to cake? What the bing.', 'speaker B: Like it.', "speaker A: Like dunbing, do you call it? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God. I love dunbing. And I love tongue. Yo bing. I just made this a couple of weeks ago because I missed it. So the green onion is so good. It's so okay. Okay. So you had this a lot? The dunbing. That's a good breakfast. One of my favorite breakfasts in Taiwan is fantuan. Do you ever eat? I know, yeah. It's so good.", "speaker B: It's popular in Japan too.", "speaker A: Yeah, I think it's really popular. The one in Japan is a little bit different though, right? But I love when I get Fonkoan every week, not every day, because it's really filling. It's really hearty. Really filling. But it's good. I really like that. But when I was growing up, the breakfast, because my mom always made me breakfast, so I didn't eat it at school. So my mom always cooked me like an egg sandwich. Like egg toast. Like dantus.", 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: She will always cook that for me. So I used to have that all the time. Yeah, it's really good. But I was wondering, you have a girlfriend, so when you are hanging out with your girlfriend, do you cook more or does she cook more?", 'speaker B: Neither.', 'speaker A: No? Neither of you cook? You like to go out?', 'speaker B: Yeah.', 'speaker A: Okay. But what about for a special occasion or something? Would you just go to a nicer restaurant? Or.', "speaker B: Would you try to cook something nicer restaurant? We can cook. We don't know how to cook.", "speaker A: You don't know how to cook? Like, nothing. You know how to cook something? You don't know how to cook anything.", 'speaker B: Just instant noodles.', 'speaker A: What about an egg? An egg? Can you cook an egg? Yeah, you can cook an egg.', "speaker B: What's the meaning of cook or some other style cook?", 'speaker A: Just cook an egg. Not some style. Not some style.', 'speaker B: Just put it in a boil anyway.', 'speaker A: Okay. Yeah. So you can do that.', "speaker B: It's so easy.", "speaker A: Okay. But there are so many things like that that are so easy for cooking. It's the same way for rice. You just put rice in the rice cooker and press the button. Right.", "speaker B: Really? But don't you need some water?", 'speaker A: Yeah, you have to add water and rice and measure it to the right ratio. Too difficult.', "speaker B: I know. Abstract process, but I haven't tried it.", 'speaker A: So when you were a kid at home, did your family usually go out and buy everything to eat? Or did one of your parents cook?', 'speaker B: My parents cook.', "speaker A: They did cook. Okay, that's nice. Did both of your parents work? So they both worked, but they cooked like dinner but not breakfast. You got that as well? They what?", 'speaker B: Cooperate?', 'speaker A: Yeah, they cooked together?', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Okay, got it. I was lucky because my mom didn't work when I was younger, so she just stayed home. So I always had breakfast and she made me lunch. And then we would take the lunch to school in like a. Oh, in.", 'speaker B: Taiwan, they call it.', 'speaker A: The lunch the have. Like, we have a different style for this, though. The lunchbox in the US, I think, is a little bit different.', "speaker B: What's a different.", "speaker A: Let me see if I can find a picture. It's just the way the types of things that we put in, like, we don't necessarily have the same kind of box, and we had different food in it, obviously. Wait, let me see. Let me show you. It's like, maybe like this. Let me see. Look, they cut it into the hello kitty shape. No way. My mom never did that. Definitely never did that. Okay. Our lunch boxes kind of look like this or like this or like these kind of bags.", 'speaker B: Okay, so the boxes are kind of decorative things.', "speaker A: Yeah, it is. So, like, kids will go to school and they'll have a really cool design on their lunchbox. You didn't."]`

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

So sometimes if you find me not following you, please slow down and let me follow you. And I'm very curious about sometimes. I will now realize some mistake I make when I'm speaking. So if you find some errors or mistakes, please track me.", 'speaker A: Sure.', 'speaker B: Thank you.', 'speaker A: So far, you have done a good job correcting yourself.', "speaker B: Yeah. So now let's start talking about some topics. For example, I want to talk with you about the teachers. So the first question I want to talk do you want to be a teacher? What's your job now?", 'speaker A: I am a teacher.', "speaker B: I'm a teacher. Besides being a teacher in cambly, right.", 'speaker A: Now I am only working on cambly, but teaching is my profession. I have been teaching for 14 years.', 'speaker B: 14 years. Amazing. Wow. I think maybe you are very interested in teaching. Do you still want to be a teacher in the future?', 'speaker A: Yes. So since 2020, I have only been teaching on cambly, but my plan is for next year to go back to teaching at school.', "speaker B: Wow. Thank you. For me, I'm very respected about. I'm very risk rated for the teacher because I think I'm very risky. Teachers are very selfless to. Yeah. Yes. The teachers are very selfless to impart their knowledge to the students.", 'speaker A: Well, I think teachers appreciate the respect. Not many people show enough respect to teachers. Sometimes in some countries, teachers are seen as servants, not something important or special.', "speaker B: Okay, sorry, can you say it again? Maybe I can't follow you.", 'speaker A: I said in some countries, teachers are seen as servants and are not respected very well.', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Like in the United States, people don't respect teachers. People think, oh, you are just a teacher. So parents and children will often be very rude to teachers. Government does not give enough money for teachers. It's a very difficult situation for teachers in the US.", "speaker B: What a. May. Some people may judge a person by salary. So I don't think this value is. I don't think is not. I don't think it's probable. Sorry.", 'speaker A: And maybe an appropriate way to value.', 'speaker B: Yeah, appropriate. Yes.', "speaker A: I agree. I have been very lucky in my life. I have been able to teach in several countries around the world. I am originally from South Africa and I started teaching in my home country. But I have lived in three different countries in Asia, and I've also lived in four different countries in South America and the asian countries. So I lived in China, Thailand and Malaysia. And the people there really respect teachers. It's a very different culture around how people think about the job, teaching. I really love that.", 'speaker B: Wow, how wonderful you have been to variety of places around the world.', 'speaker A: I have been very lucky.', "speaker B: I'm very interested in your experience. When you are in China, can you give a more detailed description?", 'speaker A: Absolutely. I actually lived in China for quite a long time. I lived in China for eight years.', 'speaker B: Eight years. So where did you live in China then?', 'speaker A: The majority of my time I lived in Hangzhou.', "speaker B: That's a beautiful city.", "speaker A: It is a beautiful city. Yeah. It is still my favorite home. When I think of home, I still think of it's. I have lived in some really amazing cities around the world. Like, I lived in Istanbul. I lived in Sao Bal. Yeah. Hangzhou is still my favorite city.", 'speaker B: Wow. Why do you think hanjo is your favorite city? You, like, are you interested in its environment or the people there?', "speaker A: A variety of reasons, actually. Of course, the environment is one of the reasons. Hangzhou is very unique because the combination of nature and modern and also ancient, historical is in a very beautiful balance in Hangzhou now. I lived in Shanghai for three months and I didn't like it because it felt like I was living in New York. Like either. Us.", 'speaker B: Definitely. Sorry. Give me a. My tongue is twisted. One month ago, I went to Shanghai with my little sister. We paid a visit to Shanghai, but I was not very happy there. Although there are many. Although there are many wonderful architectures or high buildings. Skyscraper scrapers.', 'speaker A: Skyscrapers.', "speaker B: Yeah. Skyscraper. Yeah. But although I'm. I was, I wasn't. I'm still very. Shanghai still left a very bad impression on me. I think it's very. I think it was very busy, everyone in that. Everyone in Shanghai had its own things to do. Nobody cares. Others feelings and I. Sense of loneliness.", 'speaker A: Exactly.', 'speaker B: Yeah. And I lived in province.', 'speaker A: I traveled to Hanan province, and I really enjoyed it. I was in Zhao Zhou and I was in Dengfeng.', 'speaker B: Now my hometown is in Zhao Zhou.', 'speaker A: I have two very good friends who are from there.', 'speaker B: Wow.', 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Amazing.', "speaker A: I don't know their chinese names, so I cannot tell you their chinese names. Maybe you know them or maybe you know their families.", "speaker B: I'm very amazed to hear that you have two chinese friends in my hometown.", "speaker A: My one friend, her english name is Sarah, but I believe her family name is Guo. And my other friend is Dora Chen. But I don't know what their chinese first names are. Guo and Chen are their family names. Yeah. I have been there.", "speaker B: When I'm in my hometown, I feel a sense of partners or peace or peace. But in Shanghai, I only felt lonely when I visited there. To be honest, I haven't been Hangzhou. I only learned Xi Hu from the textbook, from the tax booth. I haven't been there. Haven't been there.", "speaker A: I hope you have a chance I hope you have a chance to go. It's very special. So let's put Xihu aside for a second and just talk about the city in Shanghai. Like you said, it's very crowded. And even though there are very tall buildings, the architecture is impressive. But it feels overwhelming for me. Like, it makes.", 'speaker B: Overwhelming.', "speaker A: Yeah. In Hangzhou, the architecture is also really beautiful. We have we. They. I say we because in my mind, it is still my home. But they have very beautiful modern architecture in Hangzhou as well. But I love how there is a balance between the very modern and the historic. In Shanghai, it is like the history is hidden away. You have to go find it. But in Hangzhou, the history is everywhere and the modern is everywhere. And the two sides of China exist together with each other in what I think is a very beautiful way. And then on top of that, you have Xihu and the longjing plantations on the mountain, and you have the canals and parks that go all through the city. And if you go to the northwest, you have Shishi wetlands. It's just really a beautiful balance.", 'speaker B: Okay, sorry.', 'speaker A: Are you having technical problems?', 'speaker B: Okay. Can you hear me? Sorry. Can you, can you. Can you repeat the word? The words sorry.', "speaker A: No problem. I guess there is some technical problems. I was just saying the modern and the ancient city balance each other. And then also the nature. So Shihu, right in the middle of the city and behind Shihu you have mountains with the long Jing tea plantations on them. And also in the north of the city we have Shishi wetlands where it's also a big park where there are birds and so many trees and plants and flowers. It's a really beautiful balance between modern China, ancient China and natural China.", 'speaker B: Yes, definitely. I always think it reached a very good balance of the past and the modern China. Yeah. The modern character in Shanghai, I think is very bustling or a sense of capitalism.', "speaker A: I agree. Very capitalist. For me, I also had difficulty in Shanghai because there's too many people. I come from a small country in South Africa. We have about 60 million people in the whole country. So Shanghai is one city that has more than half my whole country.", "speaker B: Yeah, Shanghai has a very large number of people. So when I stand in Shanghai, I will have a question. Who am I and where am I? I can't find myself in this. That there is. Have you learned that asian sports meeting? Yeshou.", "speaker A: Yes, I know about that. I was. So I left Hongzhou in 2019 when this had been announced. And then I was very disappointed that I would miss it because I wasn't going to be there anymore.", 'speaker B: I hope you have next chance to pay a visit to meeting, sports meeting.', 'speaker A: I hope I have again. Yeah.', 'speaker B: Why?', "speaker A: I don't plan to come back to China soon, but I hope that I have a chance to go visit because I still have many good friends who live there.", "speaker B: So welcome to China to see your good friends. I want. Can you tell me what's your. Can you tell me a teacher in your primary school? I want to tell you. I want to talk to you about the teacher when we were in the primary middle school. What's your most impressive teacher in the primary school for me?", 'speaker A: Okay, you can ask. Tell me about your favorite teacher from primary school.', 'speaker B: Yeah, sorry. Tell me your favorite teacher in your primary school. Let me start talking first.', 'speaker A: Sorry. Yes, go ahead.', "speaker B: For me, in my primary school, I was very impressed on an English teacher as I was a student from the rural. From the rural area in one small. In one small country. I didn't get enough education in English. So I'm very scared of learning English.", 'speaker A: But.', "speaker B: I think English is not very important because when I was at primary school, I thought I will not go abroad in the future. And maybe I hadn't seen any form I hadn't seen any formers when I was little so I think it's not very I. So I. So then I was not. I thought it was not important to learn a foreign language. Why? My English teacher gives me my english teacher, but my english teacher give my confidence. Give my confidence and force me to. And force me to be sorry. Very difficult for me to give for description. Give me a second. Give me some time to think about. Can you tell me your favorite teacher in your primary school?", "speaker A: So that is not an easy question for me to answer. Firstly, primary school was a very long time ago for me. I'm 40 years old, so primary school is more than 30 years ago. Also, when I was in primary school, I attended two different schools. I went to one school for 1st, second and third grade and then I switched to a different school for 4th, fifth and 6th grade. So I don't really remember specifically my primary school teachers that well. But I had a high school english teacher who was similar for me to what you were saying about your english teacher. My situation is a little bit different. English is my first language, it's my native language. But my father put me into schools where English was not the primary language.", 'speaker B: Wow, how difficult it is for you.', "speaker A: Yeah. And I think for primary school especially, that is why maybe I don't have many good memories about school or teachers from when I was that young because I had a lot of difficulty with communication at my home. My family is a mixed family. My mother is English, my father is Afrikaans, and so we spoke English at home. And that is why my father put me into afrikaan schools because he wanted me to have both languages 50 50 equally. But it was very challenging for me because I had to learn to think in a completely different language. And my teachers did not always understand this. They often thought that I was being lazy or that I was being just naughty. Like they didn't give me any benefit of the doubt thinking that I had difficulty with the language. So primary school was very hard for me. But in high school it was much different because there my English was a benefit and my english teacher basically assigned me as her teaching assistant because she knew that my English was much more advanced than what the students were learning in the class. So that was a lot of fun for me. I could help her read or I could help her help the other students practice their speaking. Often when we would do Shakespeare in class, she and I together would act out Shakespeare for the rest of the class so that they could follow. Yeah, I really enjoyed that. And she is the reason why I became an.", "speaker B: Attuned can you might tenderize beginning my english teacher I found it very difficult for me to learn English. But my English. But my english teacher in my primary school use many methods. To use many methods to attract my interest. For example, I still remember a very little game. It's very easy. Maybe now I think it's very boring. But in the past when I was in my primary school, I thought it was very interesting. The teacher this game is called. The jewel of this game is the jew of this game is if she sees a word loudly. If she says a word loudly with students should repeat this word in a low voice instead. If she size the word in a low voice, we should respond to her in a very high voice. Although it's very simple, but although it's very simple, it definitely attracts my interest. After practicing over and over again with students manager to manage to memorize a lot of words.", 'speaker A: Yeah. I love using those games in my class when I teach children as well.', 'speaker B: Wow.', "speaker A: I think for kids, games are what interests them. So a good teacher can use games like that to encourage students to learn. Because the kids don't realize they are learning something. They just think they're.", 'speaker B: You are also a good teacher too.', "speaker A: I also really enjoy different card games because sometimes. Yeah. So with my older students, maybe 1213 years old, I will have a deck of cards that have. Some have pictures, some have words. And so I like to play a version of go fish. So go fish is a game where you want to make sets of the same cards and if you can empty your hand, all your cards are gone, then you are the winner. So they have to know the vocabulary word because they must recognize the picture and they must also be able to read the word written and match the picture with the written word. But for the kids, they think they're just playing a card game and it's a lot of fun.", "speaker B: Yes, kids don't care. Kids don't know how sorry is when they play the game. They have lenses knowledge.", "speaker A: Yeah. And for more advanced students, I will play the same game. But when they make the pair, when they put down the cards, they must make a sentence using those words as well. So there are different rules for the games for different level students. It's a great tool to use for teaching kids.", "speaker B: You have, Sarah, that your first language is English. So what's your second language?", 'speaker A: Afrikaans. Afrikaans is a south african language. Oh, our time is finished.']`

And that is why my father put me into afrikaan schools because he wanted me to have both languages 50 50 equally.

They often thought that I was being lazy or that I was being just naughty. Like they didn't give me any benefit of the doubt thinking that I had difficulty with the language. So primary school was very hard for me. But in high school it was much different because there my English was a benefit and my english teacher basically assigned me as her teaching assistant because she knew that my English was much more advanced than what the students were learning in the class. So that was a lot of fun for me. I could help her read or I could help her help the other students practice their speaking.

The jewel of this game is the jew of this game is if she sees a word loudly. If she says a word loudly with students should repeat this word in a low voice instead.

No, I bet you you're better than you think you are.", 'speaker B: We are going to have a show or before the spring festival, I have to dance. Where is that?', 'speaker A: Like in a parade?', 'speaker B: Parade?', "speaker A: Like when you're walking down the street. Like for a festival? No, in auditorium. Like a big stadium. Stadium.", 'speaker B: Small one. Small one.', 'speaker A: Small stadium.', 'speaker B: Yes. It will be my first.', 'speaker A: Are you nervous?', "speaker B: No, um, I'm not nervous now because it's like two months later.", 'speaker A: Okay, so you could be nervous in like six weeks?', "speaker B: Yes. I'm not sure because I have to travel to Indonesia and I'm not sure I will do all the class.", 'speaker A: Got you.', "speaker B: I'm not sure I will be able.", 'speaker A: To do the performance. When are you coming to Indonesia?', 'speaker B: Maybe in 27 December of December.', "speaker A: Got you. Okay, got you. Do you know what islands you're going to be going to?", "speaker B: My friends have told us, but I don't know how to translate it to English. It's Bali. This one. It's not an island.", 'speaker A: Oh, yeah. In Java?', 'speaker B: Yeah, Java.', 'speaker A: Java is. Yeah.', "speaker B: It'S the capital.", 'speaker A: The capital is in Java, but this is another area of Java. The capital is Jakarta.', 'speaker B: We will stay in Java most of the time.', 'speaker A: Okay, very cool. Do you have, like, friends?', 'speaker B: No. Is it far from Bali?', "speaker A: No, it's not far from Bali. Many people even take the bus where the bus goes on the boat and then it goes across. So. No, they're neighboring islands. I believe so. I have to double check. I'm pretty sure Yojakarta 1 second. Yocha Cartha is in Java. Yeah, sorry, I was asking my girlfriend because she's from Indonesia, so I was just double. Yeah, but I've never been there before. I wanted to travel to, uh, before the pandemic, and then when everything happened, I didn't. So I've only been to Bali and then I've been to her island in. Yeah, that's. That's further away. It's the island that looks like an octopus or something. It has a very cool shape. Oh, yeah. I have to double check the spelling. I'll butcher for sure. There we go. Because in my head I'm saying syllabesi. And that's not actually it's silhouetti. But I hear, Sylvester, when people are pronouncing it there it is like that. Yeah. So if you look at the map, it's like a very interesting shape. Yeah. But if you see, like, Java and Bali are quite close to each other.", 'speaker B: Uhoh. It.', 'speaker A: How long is your trip for it? You said a week or something? Is that what you said?', 'speaker B: Nine days.', 'speaker A: All right. Nine days is a good, good amount of trip. Better than one week. Little bit more.', 'speaker B: Poor more. And we will stay in this island, Rama.', "speaker A: I do not know where that is. Let me double check. Rama island. Oh, that's definitely not what I was looking for. They sent me to a place in Florida. That's not what I'm looking. No, you're probably right. Just Google things because I have a lot of us searches that I want to be in Florida, and that's not what I wanted. It was not helpful. Let me see. I'm zooming out to see where it is. Oh, this is in.", 'speaker B: Bali?', "speaker A: No, maybe it's looking up the wrong thing. Now it's showing Brahma. Yeah. I think it searched something else when I went into Google. That's okay. I'm not sure where it is, but.", "speaker B: It'S called as Sulawasi.", "speaker A: Yes. That's east of where I am.", 'speaker B: East.', "speaker A: And do you know where you're going to be staying when you're in Bali? You're only going to be here a couple of days, though. Yeah, I don't know.", 'speaker B: We are going with lead of someone who guide us.', "speaker A: A guide? Yeah. Gotcha. So you have a guide when you're in Java and also in Bali?", 'speaker B: Yes.', "speaker A: That's good. That'll make it easier for you.", 'speaker B: And I will stay in this place for one day. This.', "speaker A: Sam's not sure where that is.", 'speaker B: And is in Lomutown. Lomutown. This one. This one is in Bali.', "speaker A: Lumbok. No, Lumbak is not in Bali. Lumbok is. No, Lumbuck is another island. Small island. Yeah. Close to Bali, but not that close because it's very beautiful, though, for sure. Very beautiful beaches.", 'speaker B: Have you been there?', "speaker A: No, I haven't, but I had plans to go like a. There's Lombok and then there's the Gile Islands near it.", 'speaker B: Gili Islands?', "speaker A: Yeah. You may want to look into that. A lot of people like to visit the Gile Islands, especially when just doing tourist stuff. Gili Islands is near Lombok. Yeah. It's like very easy to get from Lombok to the Gilly Islands. And there's three of the Gilly Islands. There's gilly air, there's gilly tea. But yeah, there's one that's like big for partying and then there's another that's more relaxing or whatever. But they're all very pretty. But so is Lombok. If you're just going there, it should be cool as well. And what are you doing today? What's your plans for the rest of the day?", 'speaker B: The rest of the day? This afternoon I will take a rest and this evening I will take the dancing class again.', 'speaker A: Oh, nice. So every weekend you dance like twice a weekend or just sometimes.', "speaker B: Just one. Just one. And this evening is for the. What's that show?", 'speaker A: For the performance.', 'speaker B: Performance.', "speaker A: Performance. Very cool. Yeah. So I haven't had many people repeat classes yet. You're like the third or fourth person. Is there something specific that you would like to talk about or cover? Because I've already asked you the normal conversations that I usually ask.", 'speaker B: Do you mind we do some articles.', 'speaker A: Articles.', 'speaker B: Other platform.', "speaker A: From the pdfs. Sure, let's look at it.", "speaker B: No, it's PDF.", 'speaker A: No, not the PDF. Look at an article. Where is it?', 'speaker B: No, I just send you the link.', 'speaker A: Okay.', 'speaker B: Do you know how to square your screen?', "speaker A: I do not. Maybe it's on top here.", 'speaker B: Yeah, on top here.', "speaker A: Toggle screen share. Oh, yeah. Okay, well, good, because I need to learn how to do that. Let's see if I can figure it out.", 'speaker B: Send you the link.', "speaker A: So then I do screen share. Open preferences. Allow? Yes. Plus unlock. I don't know if I can do it because I haven't done it before and then I would have to close Google Chrome because to allow it. So I don't think I can at this moment to share screen. Can you share screen or no? No. Okay, then I don't know if we'll be able to do this. The link's not opening either that you sent me. It's just going blank. Yeah, it's not working for me. The link.", 'speaker B: So you can use Google in Indonesia.', 'speaker A: Okay, so you want me to just pull up an article and then talk about it? Is that what you want to do?', 'speaker B: Yes.', "speaker A: Okay, let's see here. Can you give me a topic that you'd like to talk about?", 'speaker B: Like something about Indonesia. Oh, something about how to spell Indonesia. No article found. Maybe I misspell Indonesia.', "speaker A: I sent it to you. That's how you spell it. It if you want. Instead, I can just give you some tips on how this country works and stuff like that that might be more beneficial to you than reading an article. Or do you want to read? Do you want to practice reading?", "speaker B: I don't know.", 'speaker A: Do you drive a motorbike motorcycle scooter.', 'speaker B: Many years ago.', "speaker A: But you don't ride anymore.", "speaker B: Yes, because it's very hot in my city in summer and cold in winter.", "speaker A: The experience in Bali, it's quite dangerous to drive on a bike. But the experience is you can't really fully experience Bali without being on the bike. The bike is much. You can get around everybody. But also, I told you before that I've never been anywhere where the scenery changes so fast. Yeah, you'll be in the city and then boom, you're in the rice fields or in the jungle. And when you're in a car, you don't really feel this change as much. But on the bike, you're driving around and it's like everything's surrounding you and then boom, you're just so open and this fresh air hits you. I would highly recommend, even if you don't get to drive a bike, maybe use Gojek or grab and just get a bike so you can sit on the back of a bike and feel this experience. It's quite special here. Like this scenery, this shift.", 'speaker B: You mean I need and just driver license?', "speaker A: Oh, no, you don't need a driver's license. I'm saying you just need to drive a bike. But you can also order. Do you have Gojek or what do you have in China? Like grab Uber? Dd dd there you go. So same, but here we have Gojek and grab. But you can have someone pick you up on a bike.", 'speaker B: You mean on the motorbike?', 'speaker A: Yeah, you can have someone pick you up on the motorbike and then you can sit on the back and just experience driving around.', 'speaker B: Is it cheap or expensive?', "speaker A: Yeah, it's cheap for sure. Super cheap on the bike. Yeah, definitely super cheap. Yeah. Especially if you go, like, somewhere 20 minutes, 30 minutes maybe. It cost a couple of dollars.", 'speaker B: Yeah, couple dollars.', "speaker A: I don't know. Yeah, it's not expensive for sure. And how many days did you say you're going to stay in Bali specifically? Not sure yet. Have you started to look at the historical landmarks that you're going to see in Georgia Carta? Georgia Carta? I think it's a very old city. It has many beautiful. If we take a look at the place that you sent. Yeah, it has very old. Ancient. I believe it's an ancient buddhist temple, if I remember correctly. If you scroll down, like the big buddhist temple. Let me see if I can just share this. Copied this one specifically. Many people, if I went there, I would go to see this one's. Yeah. If you're there, I would highly recommend to see that place because things like that, in my opinion, we don't really know how old they are. They'll tell you this was built this year and blah, blah, blah. But I don't know if they really like, maybe it's much, much older, like the pyramids, things of that nature.", 'speaker B: Cambodia have similar one.', "speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I think it's very similar, like a style as the one in Cambodia, for sure. And it's interesting because they're the, these islands are like, that's a muslim island and this is a hindu island, but they have a lot of old buddhist temples in these areas. So it's very interesting of how these developed and when and how far it goes back and if it does go back thousands of years or more than that, how they have the technology to build something so elaborate, so mathematically precise and so forth. I find this fascinating. What are you most excited about your trip? Are you most excited about just having work off? Are you excited about spending time with your friends? Are you excited about seeing somewhere new? What is the most exciting thing about.", 'speaker B: Most exciting thing. And I have to go to work and I have some thing, some foods, some foods are different from.', "speaker A: I would highly recommend that, yes. Go to any restaurants. The tour guide wants to take you. But you see these little spots on the side of the road with the food already out. Sometimes you can find quite nice food there for very cheap. And it might look not nice, but in India, a lot of times people get sick from the cleanness of food. But here things are pretty clean usually. Well, I eat vegetarian, so I don't know about the meat, but from my experience, I haven't had many problems even eating, like, vegetarian.", "speaker B: You mean you don't eat meat?", "speaker A: Yeah, I don't eat any meat. Well, I'm vegan, actually, so I don't eat cheese or milk or eggs or anything like that.", 'speaker B: Vegan? Is it vegan?', 'speaker A: This is how you spell it? Yeah. Or you can also say plant based. So that means like no meat, but also no dairy.', 'speaker B: No eggs, no dairy?', 'speaker A: Yeah. No milk, no butter. Nothing like this.', 'speaker B: No butter?', "speaker A: No butter? No. So it's difficult for me sometimes because I have to ask specific things, and if I don't speak the language, I have to figure out how to ask that. I can't go to bakeries places with cookies and pastries. And I love pastries, and it's very easy to make them without butter. Like, to just make them with, like, pastry.", 'speaker B: What is pastry?', "speaker A: Croissant or donut? Or donut. These are all pastries? Yeah. So pastry is a general word for sweet baked goods. But, yeah, I can't go to a normal bakery. Everything in a bakery has butter and eggs, everything. So I have to go to a special bakery that sells vegan pastries. And sometimes they're very nice. Like, some vegan pastries taste the same, but then some are very sad, like cookies. Vegan cookies are awful. Very rarely you can find a good vegan cookie, but usually it just tastes like a very sad cookie, like missing the egg in the ingredients.", 'speaker B: Is it because you are yoga teacher?', "speaker A: That was a part of it. It was just more like I was experimenting with things in the past. So I was a pescatarian for a while where I only ate fish. Yeah. But I didn't eat chicken, beef, pork. And then I became a vegetarian, like, in 2014 because I was in India, and actually the city I was in is a holy city, so they don't have, like, it's illegal to serve meat.", 'speaker B: Which city?', 'speaker A: Rishikesh.', 'speaker B: Rishikesh?', "speaker A: Yeah. They have seven holy cities in India, and all of them are vegetarian because they're hindu. Yeah. Now, they're not vegan. They eat cheese, they eat butter. They love milk. Yeah. They're very into this, but they don't eat egg. So for their vegetarian is no egg, but is dairy. And when I was in India, I saw it's actually very easy for me to eat vegetarian. There's no reason why I need it. I like vegetarian, so. And then about a year after that, I stopped eating eggs and butter and so forth, because I saw that those things, actually, it requires just as much animal cruelty as eating meat. Like, getting dairy is very difficult for animals and so forth.", "speaker B: I think maybe someday I will be this vegan. Yeah. I don't kill any those animals, fish, but I eat them. I can't stand when we boil some shrimp, I feel it's cruel. And maybe someday I will be a vegan.", "speaker A: Yeah. It's much easier to lose weight and things like this because meat takes a long time to process, digest in the body, whereas vegetables and rice digest very quickly. So you can eat a lot more and digest faster. So you can eat lots of vegetables, not lots of rice. Yeah. Rice is not so great for losing weight, but, like, rice and a lot of vegetables. I don't find it like a sacrifice. When I just stopped eating cheese, pizza was very difficult. Yeah. Because I grew up eating a lot of pizza, but now there's so many vegan cheese. Like, they make it from cashew and coconut and it tastes almost the same. So it's harder to find, obviously. Yeah. I can't go to pizza hut and get this, but there are places that just serve, like, vegan italian food. And for me, it tastes very similar. It's not exactly, but it's, in my opinion, just as good. So it's not a hard sacrifice. And I like vegetables and rice or a vegetable sandwich or whatever, so it's easy. And here they eat a lot of tempeh. Have you had tempeh?", 'speaker B: No.', "speaker A: Tempeh. The spelling, I think is like this. It might be like this, actually. I don't remember if has the h or not, but it's like tofu, but like fermented soybean. So like a soybean cake, it's a denser, thicker than tofu. They only use it in Indonesia. It's very weird. Like, Thailand doesn't use it. I don't think china uses it very much. Japan doesn't use it. But in Indonesia they love tempeh. Even, like, people who are not vegetarian, they all eat lots of tempeh.", 'speaker B: Tempeh, is it like sandwiches or does it like the source?', "speaker A: Let me show you. So it's from soybean? Yeah. Just like soybean. Yeah, it's just like tofu. Yeah. So here, let me picture. Bless you. Yeah. It's a very nice meat substitute because if you cook it in curry, it absorbs the flavor. So by itself, it's very plain, similar to tofu. Yeah, tofu can be very plain, but if you cook it in the right sauces with the right things, it can be very tasty. So it's similar like tofu but more meaty flavor.", 'speaker B: Thicker meaty flavor.', "speaker A: Yeah, but it depends what you cook it with. Yeah. If you don't cook it in anything, it kind of just tastes like. Yeah, but, yeah. When you're in Indonesia, for sure you will eat tempeh even if you don't want to. It will find a way. All Indonesians love tempeh. They have it everywhere. Yeah. Especially like at the little shops. They'll always have tempeh. But again, it depends on how they cook it, because tempeh can be very bland, very not exciting, but it also can be very exciting. Just like tofu. Yeah. You've had many tofu dishes that are like, nah, it's okay. Yeah. And then you've had other tofu dishes that are like, wow. Yeah. So it's very similar. I forgot. Do you like spicy food? I don't remember.", "speaker B: No, I don't like spicy.", "speaker A: Yeah, maybe when you're in Java. Well, they don't really use as much spice in Java. They like their food sweet. That's one thing. I don't know if you like your food sweet, but tell people, like, less sweet soy sauce, because many people in Java, they put a lot of sweet soy sauce. And for me, it ruins the taste of the food. It becomes, like, too sweet.", 'speaker B: He likes.', 'speaker A: Well, then Java will be good for you then. If you like sweet, they love it there. All right, well, you have 10 seconds. Nice to see you again. Hopefully we chat again soon.', 'speaker B: Yeah. Thank you.', 'speaker A: Bye bye.', 'speaker B: See you. Bye.']`

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"Suggestion": {"title": "Suggestion", "description": "\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u6807\u8bb0", "type": "array", "items": {"$ref": "#/definitions/Revision"}}}, "required": ["Suggestion"], "definitions": {"Revision": {"title": "Revision", "type": "object", "properties": {"Round": {"title": "Round", "description": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6570", "type": "string"}, "speaker_A": {"title": "Speaker A", "description": "speaker A \u7684\u539f\u8868\u8fbe", "type": "string"}, "speaker_B": {"title": "Speaker B", "description": "speaker B \u7684\u539f\u8868\u8fbe", "type": "string"}, "authentic_expression": {"title": "Authentic Expression", "description": "\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684authentic expression", "type": "string"}, "tags": {"title": "Tags", "description": "{\n                                            CORRECT\n                                            POLITENESS_USAGE \n                                            SENTENCE_STRUCTURE_ERROR \n                                            WORD_USAGE_ERROR \n                                            SENTENCE_SEQUENCE_ERROR\n                                            TENSE_ERROR\n                                            VOICE_ERROR\n                                            MODAL_VERB_ERROR \n                                            PRONOUN_AGREEMENT_ERROR \n                                            GRAMMAR\n                                            VOCABULARY\n                                            CLARITY_AND_FLUENCY\n                                        }\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u8005\u591a\u4e2a", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["Round", "speaker_A", "speaker_B", "authentic_expression", "tags"]}}}

No, they're neighboring islands. I believe so. I have to double check. I'm pretty sure Yojakarta 1 second. Yocha Cartha is in Java.

But also, I told you before that I've never been anywhere where the scenery changes so fast. Yeah, you'll be in the city and then boom, you're in the rice fields or in the jungle. And when you're in a car, you don't really feel this change as much. But on the bike, you're driving around and it's like everything's surrounding you and then boom, you're just so open and this fresh air hits you.

But you can also order. Do you have Gojek or what do you have in China? Like grab Uber? Dd dd there you go. So same, but here we have Gojek and grab. But you can have someone pick you up on a bike.", 'speaker B: You mean on the motorbike?', 'speaker A: Yeah, you can have someone pick you up on the motorbike and then you can sit on the back and just experience driving around.', 'speaker B: Is it cheap or expensive?', "speaker A: Yeah, it's cheap for sure. Super cheap on the bike. Yeah, definitely super cheap. Yeah. Especially if you go, like, somewhere 20 minutes, 30 minutes maybe. It cost a couple of dollars.", 'speaker B: Yeah, couple dollars.', "speaker A: I don't know. Yeah, it's not expensive for sure. And how many days did you say you're going to stay in Bali specifically? Not sure yet. Have you started to look at the historical landmarks that you're going to see in Georgia Carta? Georgia Carta? I think it's a very old city. It has many beautiful. If we take a look at the place that you sent. Yeah, it has very old. Ancient. I believe it's an ancient buddhist temple, if I remember correctly. If you scroll down, like the big buddhist temple. Let me see if I can just share this. Copied this one specifically. Many people, if I went there, I would go to see this one's. Yeah. If you're there, I would highly recommend to see that place because things like that, in my opinion, we don't really know how old they are. They'll tell you this was built this year and blah, blah, blah. But I don't know if they really like, maybe it's much, much older, like the pyramids, things of that nature.", 'speaker B: Cambodia have similar one.', "speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I think it's very similar, like a style as the one in Cambodia, for sure. And it's interesting because they're the, these islands are like, that's a muslim island and this is a hindu island, but they have a lot of old buddhist temples in these areas. So it's very interesting of how these developed and when and how far it goes back and if it does go back thousands of years or more than that, how they have the technology to build something so elaborate, so mathematically precise and so forth. I find this fascinating. What are you most excited about your trip? Are you most excited about just having work off? Are you excited about spending time with your friends? Are you excited about seeing somewhere new? What is the most exciting thing about.", 'speaker B: Most exciting thing. And I have to go to work and I have some thing, some foods, some foods are different from.', "speaker A: I would highly recommend that, yes. Go to any restaurants. The tour guide wants to take you. But you see these little spots on the side of the road with the food already out. Sometimes you can find quite nice food there for very cheap. And it might look not nice, but in India, a lot of times people get sick from the cleanness of food. But here things are pretty clean usually. Well, I eat vegetarian, so I don't know about the meat, but from my experience, I haven't had many problems even eating, like, vegetarian.", "speaker B: You mean you don't eat meat?", "speaker A: Yeah, I don't eat any meat. Well, I'm vegan, actually, so I don't eat cheese or milk or eggs or anything like that.", 'speaker B: Vegan? Is it vegan?', 'speaker A: This is how you spell it? Yeah. Or you can also say plant based. So that means like no meat, but also no dairy.', 'speaker B: No eggs, no dairy?', 'speaker A: Yeah. No milk, no butter. Nothing like this.', 'speaker B: No butter?', "speaker A: No butter? No. So it's difficult for me sometimes because I have to ask specific things, and if I don't speak the language, I have to figure out how to ask that. I can't go to bakeries places with cookies and pastries. And I love pastries, and it's very easy to make them without butter. Like, to just make them with, like, pastry.", 'speaker B: What is pastry?', "speaker A: Croissant or donut? Or donut. These are all pastries? Yeah. So pastry is a general word for sweet baked goods. But, yeah, I can't go to a normal bakery. Everything in a bakery has butter and eggs, everything. So I have to go to a special bakery that sells vegan pastries. And sometimes they're very nice. Like, some vegan pastries taste the same, but then some are very sad, like cookies. Vegan cookies are awful. Very rarely you can find a good vegan cookie, but usually it just tastes like a very sad cookie, like missing the egg in the ingredients.", 'speaker B: Is it because you are yoga teacher?', "speaker A: That was a part of it. It was just more like I was experimenting with things in the past. So I was a pescatarian for a while where I only ate fish. Yeah. But I didn't eat chicken, beef, pork. And then I became a vegetarian, like, in 2014 because I was in India, and actually the city I was in is a holy city, so they don't have, like, it's illegal to serve meat.", 'speaker B: Which city?', 'speaker A: Rishikesh.', 'speaker B: Rishikesh?', "speaker A: Yeah. They have seven holy cities in India, and all of them are vegetarian because they're hindu. Yeah. Now, they're not vegan. They eat cheese, they eat butter. They love milk. Yeah. They're very into this, but they don't eat egg. So for their vegetarian is no egg, but is dairy. And when I was in India, I saw it's actually very easy for me to eat vegetarian. There's no reason why I need it. I like vegetarian, so. And then about a year after that, I stopped eating eggs and butter and so forth, because I saw that those things, actually, it requires just as much animal cruelty as eating meat. Like, getting dairy is very difficult for animals and so forth.", "speaker B: I think maybe someday I will be this vegan. Yeah. I don't kill any those animals, fish, but I eat them. I can't stand when we boil some shrimp, I feel it's cruel. And maybe someday I will be a vegan.", "speaker A: Yeah. It's much easier to lose weight and things like this because meat takes a long time to process, digest in the body, whereas vegetables and rice digest very quickly. So you can eat a lot more and digest faster. So you can eat lots of vegetables, not lots of rice. Yeah. Rice is not so great for losing weight, but, like, rice and a lot of vegetables. I don't find it like a sacrifice. When I just stopped eating cheese, pizza was very difficult. Yeah. Because I grew up eating a lot of pizza, but now there's so many vegan cheese. Like, they make it from cashew and coconut and it tastes almost the same. So it's harder to find, obviously. Yeah. I can't go to pizza hut and get this, but there are places that just serve, like, vegan italian food. And for me, it tastes very similar. It's not exactly, but it's, in my opinion, just as good. So it's not a hard sacrifice. And I like vegetables and rice or a vegetable sandwich or whatever, so it's easy. And here they eat a lot of tempeh. Have you had tempeh?", 'speaker B: No.', "speaker A: Tempeh. The spelling, I think is like this. It might be like this, actually. I don't remember if has the h or not, but it's like tofu, but like fermented soybean. So like a soybean cake, it's a denser, thicker than tofu. They only use it in Indonesia. It's very weird. Like, Thailand doesn't use it. I don't think china uses it very much. Japan doesn't use it. But in Indonesia they love tempeh. Even, like, people who are not vegetarian, they all eat lots of tempeh.", 'speaker B: Tempeh, is it like sandwiches or does it like the source?', "speaker A: Let me show you. So it's from soybean? Yeah. Just like soybean. Yeah, it's just like tofu. Yeah. So here, let me picture. Bless you. Yeah. It's a very nice meat substitute because if you cook it in curry, it absorbs the flavor. So by itself, it's very plain, similar to tofu. Yeah, tofu can be very plain, but if you cook it in the right sauces with the right things, it can be very tasty. So it's similar like tofu but more meaty flavor.", 'speaker B: Thicker meaty flavor.', "speaker A: Yeah, but it depends what you cook it with. Yeah. If you don't cook it in anything, it kind of just tastes like. Yeah, but, yeah. When you're in Indonesia, for sure you will eat tempeh even if you don't want to. It will find a way. All Indonesians love tempeh. They have it everywhere. Yeah. Especially like at the little shops. They'll always have tempeh. But again, it depends on how they cook it, because tempeh can be very bland, very not exciting, but it also can be very exciting. Just like tofu. Yeah. You've had many tofu dishes that are like, nah, it's okay. Yeah. And then you've had other tofu dishes that are like, wow. Yeah. So it's very similar. I forgot. Do you like spicy food? I don't remember.", "speaker B: No, I don't like spicy.", "speaker A: Yeah, maybe when you're in Java. Well, they don't really use as much spice in Java. They like their food sweet. That's one thing. I don't know if you like your food sweet, but tell people, like, less sweet soy sauce, because many people in Java, they put a lot of sweet soy sauce. And for me, it ruins the taste of the food. It becomes, like, too sweet.", 'speaker B: He likes.', 'speaker A: Well, then Java will be good for you then. If you like sweet, they love it there. All right, well, you have 10 seconds. Nice to see you again. Hopefully we chat again soon.', 'speaker B: Yeah. Thank you.', 'speaker A: Bye bye.', 'speaker B: See you. Bye.']`

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```

And how many days did you say you're going to stay in Bali specifically? Not sure yet. Have you started to look at the historical landmarks that you're going to see in Georgia Carta? Georgia Carta? I think it's a very old city. It has many beautiful. If we take a look at the place that you sent. Yeah, it has very old. Ancient. I believe it's an ancient buddhist temple, if I remember correctly. If you scroll down, like the big buddhist temple. Let me see if I can just share this. Copied this one specifically. Many people, if I went there, I would go to see this one's. Yeah. If you're there, I would highly recommend to see that place because things like that, in my opinion, we don't really know how old they are. They'll tell you this was built this year and blah, blah, blah. But I don't know if they really like, maybe it's much, much older, like the pyramids, things of that nature.", 'speaker B: Cambodia have similar one.', "speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I think it's very similar, like a style as the one in Cambodia, for sure. And it's interesting because they're the, these islands are like, that's a muslim island and this is a hindu island, but they have a lot of old buddhist temples in these areas. So it's very interesting of how these developed and when and how far it goes back and if it does go back thousands of years or more than that, how they have the technology to build something so elaborate, so mathematically precise and so forth.

And it might look not nice, but in India, a lot of times people get sick from the cleanness of food. But here things are pretty clean usually. Well, I eat vegetarian, so I don't know about the meat, but from my experience, I haven't had many problems even eating, like, vegetarian.", "speaker B: You mean you don't eat meat?", "speaker A: Yeah, I don't eat any meat. Well, I'm vegan, actually, so I don't eat cheese or milk or eggs or anything like that.", 'speaker B: Vegan? Is it vegan?', 'speaker A: This is how you spell it? Yeah. Or you can also say plant based. So that means like no meat, but also no dairy.', 'speaker B: No eggs, no dairy?', 'speaker A: Yeah. No milk, no butter. Nothing like this.', 'speaker B: No butter?', "speaker A: No butter? No. So it's difficult for me sometimes because I have to ask specific things, and if I don't speak the language, I have to figure out how to ask that. I can't go to bakeries places with cookies and pastries. And I love pastries, and it's very easy to make them without butter. Like, to just make them with, like, pastry.", 'speaker B: What is pastry?', "speaker A: Croissant or donut? Or donut. These are all pastries? Yeah. So pastry is a general word for sweet baked goods. But, yeah, I can't go to a normal bakery. Everything in a bakery has butter and eggs, everything. So I have to go to a special bakery that sells vegan pastries. And sometimes they're very nice. Like, some vegan pastries taste the same, but then some are very sad, like cookies. Vegan cookies are awful. Very rarely you can find a good vegan cookie, but usually it just tastes like a very sad cookie, like missing the egg in the ingredients.", 'speaker B: Is it because you are yoga teacher?', "speaker A: That was a part of it. It was just more like I was experimenting with things in the past. So I was a pescatarian for a while where I only ate fish. Yeah. But I didn't eat chicken, beef, pork. And then I became a vegetarian, like, in 2014 because I was in India, and actually the city I was in is a holy city, so they don't have, like, it's illegal to serve meat.", 'speaker B: Which city?', 'speaker A: Rishikesh.', 'speaker B: Rishikesh?', "speaker A: Yeah. They have seven holy cities in India, and all of them are vegetarian because they're hindu. Yeah. Now, they're not vegan. They eat cheese, they eat butter. They love milk. Yeah. They're very into this, but they don't eat egg. So for their vegetarian is no egg, but is dairy. And when I was in India, I saw it's actually very easy for me to eat vegetarian. There's no reason why I need it. I like vegetarian, so. And then about a year after that, I stopped eating eggs and butter and so forth, because I saw that those things, actually, it requires just as much animal cruelty as eating meat. Like, getting dairy is very difficult for animals and so forth.", "speaker B: I think maybe someday I will be this vegan. Yeah. I don't kill any those animals, fish, but I eat them. I can't stand when we boil some shrimp, I feel it's cruel. And maybe someday I will be a vegan.", "speaker A: Yeah. It's much easier to lose weight and things like this because meat takes a long time to process, digest in the body, whereas vegetables and rice digest very quickly. So you can eat a lot more and digest faster. So you can eat lots of vegetables, not lots of rice. Yeah. Rice is not so great for losing weight, but, like, rice and a lot of vegetables. I don't find it like a sacrifice. When I just stopped eating cheese, pizza was very difficult. Yeah. Because I grew up eating a lot of pizza, but now there's so many vegan cheese. Like, they make it from cashew and coconut and it tastes almost the same. So it's harder to find, obviously. Yeah. I can't go to pizza hut and get this, but there are places that just serve, like, vegan italian food. And for me, it tastes very similar. It's not exactly, but it's, in my opinion, just as good. So it's not a hard sacrifice. And I like vegetables and rice or a vegetable sandwich or whatever, so it's easy. And here they eat a lot of tempeh. Have you had tempeh?", 'speaker B: No.', "speaker A: Tempeh. The spelling, I think is like this. It might be like this, actually. I don't remember if has the h or not, but it's like tofu, but like fermented soybean. So like a soybean cake, it's a denser, thicker than tofu. They only use it in Indonesia. It's very weird. Like, Thailand doesn't use it. I don't think china uses it very much. Japan doesn't use it. But in Indonesia they love tempeh. Even, like, people who are not vegetarian, they all eat lots of tempeh.", 'speaker B: Tempeh, is it like sandwiches or does it like the source?', "speaker A: Let me show you. So it's from soybean? Yeah. Just like soybean. Yeah, it's just like tofu. Yeah. So here, let me picture. Bless you. Yeah. It's a very nice meat substitute because if you cook it in curry, it absorbs the flavor. So by itself, it's very plain, similar to tofu. Yeah, tofu can be very plain, but if you cook it in the right sauces with the right things, it can be very tasty. So it's similar like tofu but more meaty flavor.", 'speaker B: Thicker meaty flavor.', "speaker A: Yeah, but it depends what you cook it with. Yeah. If you don't cook it in anything, it kind of just tastes like. Yeah, but, yeah. When you're in Indonesia, for sure you will eat tempeh even if you don't want to. It will find a way. All Indonesians love tempeh. They have it everywhere. Yeah. Especially like at the little shops. They'll always have tempeh. But again, it depends on how they cook it, because tempeh can be very bland, very not exciting, but it also can be very exciting. Just like tofu. Yeah. You've had many tofu dishes that are like, nah, it's okay. Yeah. And then you've had other tofu dishes that are like, wow. Yeah. So it's very similar. I forgot. Do you like spicy food? I don't remember.", "speaker B: No, I don't like spicy.", "speaker A: Yeah, maybe when you're in Java. Well, they don't really use as much spice in Java. They like their food sweet. That's one thing. I don't know if you like your food sweet, but tell people, like, less sweet soy sauce, because many people in Java, they put a lot of sweet soy sauce. And for me, it ruins the taste of the food. It becomes, like, too sweet.", 'speaker B: He likes.', 'speaker A: Well, then Java will be good for you then. If you like sweet, they love it there. All right, well, you have 10 seconds. Nice to see you again. Hopefully we chat again soon.', 'speaker B: Yeah. Thank you.', 'speaker A: Bye bye.', 'speaker B: See you. Bye.']`

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```

My laptop is going to die. I'm getting my charger, but keep talking. I can hear you. Yes. So these, like, these mushrooms these mushrooms are like people take them for fun. Probably not in China, but in here, people take them for fun, like take jobs, you know what I mean?", 'speaker B: Yeah, like taking a dog.', "speaker A: You don't do that. Is it expensive? It's more expensive than just, like, the mushrooms you eat, but I don't think so. They're not like crazy expensive. I have had them for and they're like, they're."]`

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```

Not too fun, but it was okay.', 'speaker A: Laundry, what does the mean of the laundry?', 'speaker B: Oh, laundry is basically where you kind of wash your clothes.', 'speaker A: Sorry. Most of the time I will use the automatic washing machine, saving my lot of clothes and wait for a moment to use the automatic washing machine.', "speaker B: Yeah, I did the same thing, but I don't have my own washing machine in my unit, so I have to go to another place and do it myself. Yeah, but they have like the wash and fold services here, downstairs.", "speaker A: It's far. Or is it far?", 'speaker B: I have to commute there. Yeah.', "speaker A: Oh, it's so unconvenient.", "speaker B: It's kind of annoying. But I think the only annoying part is because it's the Christmas season and it's super busy, it's hard to get.", 'speaker A: Yeah.', "speaker B: Especially when you're like big bags.", 'speaker A: Yeah. At Beijing I think there is no such crowded people when the Christmas holiday.', 'speaker B: Nice.', 'speaker A: Yeah. And right now Beijing is in fact Beijing experienced several days snow.', "speaker B: Yeah. I can see you're wearing warm clothes.", 'speaker A: Yeah. We have several days of snow and maybe we call it snowstorm.', 'speaker B: Snow days in the snowstorm.', 'speaker A: Yeah. And the snow over the road takes several days to be cleaned.', 'speaker B: But everything is okay though? There is no power outages or stuff like that?', "speaker A: No, that's good. It just takes three or four days. It's just a short time. Right now. Everything is recovery.", "speaker B: Okay, that's good. So is it hard to get around when there's like a snowstorm? I imagine it's hard.", "speaker A: Yeah, it's really hard because there is a day is snowing heavily and I need to commute to another place to have a meeting with my classmates. We can see how meeting with my tutor and other students. In fact, we have talking on Kambali when I visited here. There. Chinese Academy of Science.", 'speaker B: Wait, so you met your cambly tutor in.', 'speaker A: No, no, not a cambly tutor.', 'speaker B: From your school, from your university.', "speaker A: It's my academic tutor.

And the day I talk with you. Yeah. The snow is not so heavily. Yeah. And I think for Beijing the Christmas holiday is just a marketing dominant day. Yeah.', "speaker B: It's not for most places, honestly.", "speaker A: Yeah. Lots of holidays in China are about marketing advertisement.

Sometimes it happens in nine.", 'speaker B: In September.', 'speaker A: September or August.', "speaker B: Okay, so it's different from the western Valentine's Day because it's always February 14.", "speaker A: Yeah, it's different system. But I think even if it's the traditional one, it's really about advertisement.", 'speaker B: Definitely. Everybody is encouraged to buy chocolate gifts like that, right?', 'speaker A: Yeah. A lot of flowers at these festivals. The shopping mall are crowded. Really corded.', 'speaker B: Yeah, definitely. But for Christmas also, do people do gift exchanges and stuff like that?

If they want to organize an activity, they will use Christmas holiday.', 'speaker B: Yeah.', 'speaker A: Sometimes they also use the new Year holiday.', 'speaker B: The Chinese New Year.', "speaker A: Not Chinese New Year. Because at Lunar New Year, Chinese New Year, we are in holiday. We are not in school and we are not at work. So most of the time we will use western New Year. It's February. January 1. Yeah, January 1. Because at this we are still in school and we are still at work. Because the western New Year. Just how? One day holiday. Yeah. Lots of people won't leave their job.", "speaker B: Christmas. Yeah. Well, Christmas and New Year's Day. The western new year is on a Monday. Yeah. So do you have to go to school on Monday? Like on Christmas Day?", 'speaker A: Oh, Christmas Day is not a holiday in China.', 'speaker B: Okay.', 'speaker A: But a lot of people will celebrate this.', 'speaker B: Like, how do you usually celebrate Christmas?', "speaker A: It's pretty simple. Just take parking, some activities. I have a memory that when I was in middle school, every year we will have.", 'speaker B: Like a celebration type thing.', 'speaker A: Yeah. Evening party. Because we have fixed classes and the whole classmates will sitting on the classroom and have some activities like dancing and sounding nice. Yeah. And eating some snacks. Yeah.

I think for me I have strong mind that before the Christmas day I will have an apple.', "speaker B: An apple. So that's your tradition is having an apple before Christmas. So Christmas Eve?", "speaker A: Yeah, it's something like that. Maybe I don't. Christmas Eve? Yeah, it's like that.", 'speaker B: Christmas Eve. Oh yeah, Christmas Eve. That will be on Sunday. Next Sunday.', 'speaker A: Yeah.', "speaker B: I can't believe how time is going by so fast. And we're already at the end of the year, right?", "speaker A: Yeah, it's so fast. And when you think about that, I will feel much more anxiety because.", "speaker B: No, I'm sorry.", "speaker A: But I think it can't be avoid.", 'speaker B: I completely understand.', 'speaker A: When I look back, I will realize that I waste a lot of time too.', "speaker B: No, but you've been very busy. From what I can recall, you've been doing a lot of research and schoolwork. Plus you also went on that trip a while ago. I remember you went like you were driving on that solo trip. So cool.", "speaker A: Yeah. In fact, I also have another trip after that. It's almost November. Sorry. Really? All familiar with different months. November 22 and another of my friend went to the Great Wall. You went to the Great Wall over Beijing. Because grid wall is a very large area and the some of the area are decoration, are decorated and development to be a tourist attraction. But most part of the Great Wall are just buried just in nature and emerging nature. And we visited somewhere outside Beijing and it isn't development.", "speaker B: It's not developed.", "speaker A: Yeah, it's not developed. It's just very natural path. It's just very natural path. And is the gold altitude. Yeah, the attitude is pretty high. It's 1500 meters above the sea level and you know, Beijing is zero, the city zero. We need to drive through the mountains.", 'speaker B: The mountains.', "speaker A: Yeah. When I driving the car, my air will feel that you take a flight. Something like that. So I'm. I'm pretty busy. But in fact my own research work is pretty slow. Even I have a cooperation with. I have a cooperation work. I also submit our substrate to an international conference. But my own research is conducting very slow. So I take three years.", 'speaker B: You just mentioned it takes a long time.', "speaker A: I take a long time to conduct my own research. But I haven't published any article, even submit any article. When I think about that, I will realize I'm. I'm. I'm fall behind of my. My peers because a lot of my peers will graduate next year. But I still. I think I still have two years to go, 1.5 years. So for me. So I. I think the best solution for me is to justify, modify my own heart and to suit the difficult situation. In fact, I think I'm a little bit. How to describe food in restlessness or restless frequency. Little bit frequent. Yeah. You can't sit aside and so restless. Yeah, restless. Something like that.", 'speaker B: Restless.', "speaker A: And you can't sit aside and just read the books because I think that the original reason of that is I don't have feedback yet. Positive feedback. Because when you spend three years on just only one project and without any output, you will feel that. I recently treated myself to feel the happiness. Happiness in our daily life. Because I realized that I just focus too heavily. Focus on my research too heavily. So my life is unbalanced. Because I sometimes will feel unhappy or happy according to my research situation. Sometimes my research. So some problem of my research is solving. I will feel happy. If some problem appears in my research, I will feel really unhappy. I don't want to do anything so that make me inefficient. So I need to rebalance my life. So I need to get a control.", 'speaker B: Your happiness kind of relies on the results of your research.', "speaker A: Yeah. It's not bad. But if you too heavily rely on the situation, that makes you really inefficient, efficient. Sometimes I will take months to take several months to finish just one simple work of my research. Yeah, I will waste a lot of time. I think the best way to deal with the situation is to rebalance and feel happiness and feel. It's like dopamine. When you do something, you need dopamine to feel your energy or feel your it. To let you to do something. When you familiar with very high level dopamine activity, you won't feel happy. When you are daily life, like eating some meats, like clean the room. I did feel that I don't have energy to clean the room, to wash my shoes or wash my clothes and enjoy my daily life. Because sometimes when I feel very difficult to doing conducting my research, I will tend to watch some videos, check my.", 'speaker B: Cell phone, distract ourselves, right?', "speaker A: Yeah. To do some high level dopamine activities. So that's to make my life much more unbalanced.", "speaker B: I'm sorry.", "speaker A: It'S just thought of myself. It's okay. I think we just found some way to solve that. There is no really difficult situation that you can't solve.", "speaker B: A matter of us putting the work into solving it and stuff. But sometimes it's a little bit. Some things are harder to solve than others, right?", 'speaker A: Yeah. And I still have time to finish my own research, so I can do. Just do whatever I can do.', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: I recognize you opened the website. It's the article we talked about last time.", 'speaker B: Oh yeah. Is this where we left off?', "speaker A: Sorry. I don't.", 'speaker B: Forgot.', 'speaker A: Assertive. Okay. Assertive or aggressive behavior not. Consider the other side. If your style is aggressive, you may come across a bully. Bully who ignoring others, needs, feelings and options. You can appear self rhetorical, righteous and superior. Very aggressive people embraced, intimidate and scare others and may even be physically threatening. Bully? Yeah, bully school. There exists bullies in our school, especially in primary school and in middle school and high school is no bully because we are focused on academic academics.', "speaker B: But when we're in elementary school, I think kids are mean.", 'speaker A: Yeah. They are really natural, uneducated.', 'speaker B: But as we get older, usually it improves, right?', "speaker A: Yeah. But I think this natural situation is very useful for us to live in the society because some people, they are different, exist different. Really different people. Some people are just evil and they try to hurt you. They try to destroy your boundary. So we really need to learn how to deal with the situation when someone bullying you, especially when you have some conflict with someone, I think it's a lesson we need to learn. I do want to learn something about that. First, how to deal with the bullying in school so I can be prepared when I was a parent.", 'speaker B: Yeah, you can help your kids out, right?', "speaker A: Yeah. And also it's a very wise bully is a social issue. And also when you have conflict, for example, if somebody tried to hurt you, how to do.", 'speaker B: How to defend for yourself, how to protect yourself, and.', "speaker A: How to obey the law. Sometimes you fight them. Maybe you break the law and you will lose a lot of money. And that's true.", 'speaker B: You always have to be careful of those things too.', 'speaker A: Yeah, I do want to learn something about that recently. You may think being aggressive gets you what you want. However, it comes at a cost. Aggressive weaken trust and mutual respect. Others come to resent you, leading them to avoid or opposite you.', 'speaker B: Oppose you.', "speaker A: Oppose you. Assertive or passive aggressive behavior. Not consider passive aggressive behavior if you communicate in a passive aggressive manner, you may say yes. When you want to say no, you may be sacrific or complain about others behind their backs rather than sarcastic. Sarcastic. Or complain about others behind their backs rather than confront an issue directly. Confront an issue directly. You may show your anger and feelings through your actions and negative attitude. You may have developed a passive aggressive style because you are uncomfortable being direct about your needs and feelings. Yeah. If you don't say, lots of people will ignore your feelings. It's really bad for your communication. Health and communicating also for your relationship. It will destroy your relationship if you construct a mutual respect, of course.", 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: And what are the drawback of passive aggressive communication style over time? Passive aggressive behavior damage relationship and weakening mutual respect. This makes it difficult for you to get your goals and needs. Mismatch the benefit of being aggressive. Being aggressive is usually viewed as a healthier communication. Be authority is usually viewed as a healthier communicate style. Assertive things offer many benefits. It helps you keep people from taking advantage of you. We don't have time. Maybe we see just.", "speaker B: Yeah, I'll see you next week. Okay, so I'll see you on."]`

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Which one is your favorite?", 'speaker B: The Philippines.', 'speaker A: The Philippines?', 'speaker B: Cool.', "speaker A: I've never been to the Philippines before. No? Why? Did it make it your favorite country in East Asia?", 'speaker B: I like diving.', 'speaker A: Diving? Cool. Yeah. What was the most beautiful thing you saw in the ocean?', 'speaker B: Nudie blanches. There are many nudie blanches under the sea.', "speaker A: Very cool. All right, since you're going to travel, let's do one of these courses on airports. Travel.", 'speaker B: Airports.', 'speaker A: Does that interest you? Or do you want to pick something else?', "speaker B: I'll pick one from other platform. Use this one. Control. I'll send you this and do you live near the sea?", "speaker A: Yeah, actually, the ocean is, like, right there. I can see it from my balcony. Yeah. Our place is small and it's kind of a funny place, but it's a very nice view.", 'speaker B: Can I see the view?', 'speaker A: It would be difficult for me to rearrange everything. You sent me this link. What should we do with this daily news? Find something interesting just to talk about.', 'speaker B: Yes.', 'speaker A: Okay. Japanese quote. So you just want me to pick something from the news? Testing, naming rules. Do you have any kids or do your friends have any kids?', 'speaker B: My colleagues. They have kids?', "speaker A: Yeah. And will they bring them with the trip or they just stay home with their husbands? What I was going to open up was going to be let it travel. Was going to suggest we look at some of these vocabulary words and stuff. But if that's not interesting to you, we can just continue conversating about traveling. When you were in Cambodia, how did you find the food in comparison to the food in China?", "speaker B: I don't know. I just said, like, the food from other countries, not the food in.", 'speaker A: Okay. Like western food?', 'speaker B: Yes.', 'speaker A: Okay. So in Thailand, did you eat more thai food or did you also eat western thai food?', 'speaker B: No thai food.', "speaker A: So the cambodian food wasn't very interesting?", 'speaker B: Maybe.', "speaker A: I've never had cambodian food. That's why I asked. I've never been to Cambodia. I've been to Thailand a lot, but not Cambodia.", 'speaker B: We like thai food.', 'speaker A: Yeah. Do you like spicy food?', "speaker B: Most of the time I don't like spicy food. But in Thailand we have the spicy food because it's the most delicious. So we have to eating the spicy food and at the same time we drink the cold water and the ice because the tongue is very hot. But we like Thai Food.", 'speaker A: Do you prefer the noodles or the rice dishes?', 'speaker B: No. Seafood? Not noodles. Not rice.', 'speaker A: Seafood. But you eat the seafood by itself or you eat it with rice?', "speaker B: Don't remember rice? Yes. The rice are different from here.", 'speaker A: Yeah. And when was the last time that you went to Thailand?', 'speaker B: The last time on 2019. I ran a half marathon in Thailand.', 'speaker A: Wow, very cool. So you run often before the COVID Before COVID Okay.', 'speaker B: Yeah.', 'speaker A: Half marathon. How many kilometers is that?', 'speaker B: 2021.', "speaker A: That's a pretty serious run. And you did it in Thailand. How was the weather when you were running?", "speaker B: It was in midnight. It's early morning. I have to get up at about 304:00 in the morning and start running when it's dark. So it's very hot in the daytime, but it's okay in the early morning, like five or 06:00 in the morning. 04:00 maybe I remember.", "speaker A: Is that the first half marathon that you've ran or have you ran others before?", "speaker B: I ran like 14 km. It's a mini marathon in my city.", "speaker A: Very cool. Yeah. I don't think I could run 20. Think my heart would explode. It sounds very difficult.", "speaker B: And it's because when I'm traveling in Cambodia, we meet some people, we have some friends who travel with us. And she ran a half marathon and I thought, I can do that. So it was in 2017 and I practiced for one year and ran a half marathon in maybe more than one year.", "speaker A: That's awesome. That's a great accomplishment. Congratulations.", 'speaker B: Yeah. And then the COVID broke and so I stopped running.', 'speaker A: Do you think that you might try to start again soon? No desire.', 'speaker B: I just practice running before some trip because I have to.', 'speaker A: Walk a lot. When you.', 'speaker B: Yes, yes. Do a lot of city work.', 'speaker A: Do you have some places in mind in Bali that you plan to visit? Have you planned out your.', 'speaker B: No, no. I like to learn surfing. Do you have any recommendations?', 'speaker A: Yeah, you should.', 'speaker B: The club or the site?', "speaker A: The best places are down in Ulawatsu. So if you look at the islands. Let's see here. So let me find.", 'speaker B: Is it far from Bali?', "speaker A: No, it's in Bali. It's just the south part.", 'speaker B: South part?', "speaker A: Yeah. It's like if you look at the map, there's a bottom peninsula. That peninsula. Peninsula is like an island is covered with water, but the peninsula is covered on three sides. So the modern peninsula I have saved. How do I send it to you? Well, if you just search Ulawatsu, you'll be able to.", 'speaker B: Can you type the name Ulawatu?', "speaker A: I don't know why it won't let me do it now. Oh, there we go. There's message. Okay. Ulawatu beach. That's just the Google search on Uluatsu beach because there's many beaches down there. But that's the main area where most of the surfers go because there's a lot of popular beaches up because I'm near some of the more popular beaches for, like, seafood. And then the party beaches are about 20 minutes north. But the most south is the best for surfing and also the most beautiful ocean. Like all of that, the pictures of Bali with the blue turquoise color, that's an ulawatu. So here we have very beautiful color as well because we're already going towards those. Yeah, just the bottomest part. And it's easy to find accommodations and areas. And do you drive a scooter.", 'speaker B: Scooter. Scooter. Yes.', 'speaker A: Yeah. You drive a.', 'speaker B: Yes.', "speaker A: Yeah. The easiest way. If you just rent a motorbike and then you can go around, it's not so bad driving in that area, but in the city it can be a little bit hectic. But you drive in China, so I think that you'll be fine driving around. But it's a bit hectic here driving. A lot of people have problems when they try hate. Do you know the word chaotic? Chaos. Yes, it's similar synonyms. Yes. Crowded. But also in Thailand we have rules. Yes. People are on this side and people are on that side. In Bali, on the road, there's no rules and the police only pull people over for not wearing a helmet or not really anything really. It's usually just picking people. But you can speed, you can run red lights, you can do anything and nothing happens. So it's very chaotic, very hectic. How is the driving in your city? Is there a lot of traffic?", "speaker B: I don't know. I just buy bus by the subway towards.", 'speaker A: Got you.', 'speaker B: Most of my colleagues, they buy their ebike.', 'speaker A: Got you.', 'speaker B: The traffic is, I think, terrible.', "speaker A: Got you. So it's much easier to use public transportation.", 'speaker B: Yes.', 'speaker A: I wish we had public transportation here.', "speaker B: I just sit there and read some articles and I don't know what's happening outside.", "speaker A: Yeah, that's awesome. How long are you planning to visit Bali for? Do you know the duration of your stay? Maybe like a week or nine weeks.", 'speaker B: Nine days or maybe nine or ten days.', 'speaker A: Got you. And you want to surf most of the time or you just want to try surfing.', "speaker B: I haven't told my friends I want to learn surfing and they want to do like city walk and they want to see the volcano and maybe dive for one or two days. But I like to learn surfing.", "speaker A: If you really want to learn surfing, I really recommend. You've already traveled a lot. If it was new to you, I would say, yeah, you should go to many places. But Bali, with the traffic, it can be very overwhelming if you try to see many things. So if you have this goal of something that you know will make you happy just going and staying in Ulawatu for most of the time you're there, I think you'll enjoy your time more because it's quite calm down there. But the minute I'm in the spot, that's like right below where things start to get super hectic. But it's already a bit. And then, yeah, Bali is not that crazy. But if you try to get from place to place. The traffic is very bad, especially in a car, and it can be very exhausting. But if you stay and just surf, I think you'll have an amazing time.", 'speaker B: Can I dive in this?', "speaker A: Yeah. There is also diving down in that area as well. Yeah. And then, like I said, if you rent a bike, or you can also, if you don't want to rent a bike, you can just use gojek or grabber, like the uber type of stuff. It's very easy. Yeah.", 'speaker B: Which one is the most commonly used?', "speaker A: So there's grab and there's Gojek. Both seem to be owned by the same people. They look the same, they operate very much the same. Everyone kind of uses both because sometimes the price goes up on one and down on the other, and then they switch. And that's why I think they might just be owned by the same people. But, yeah, it's very easy. But my recommendation is use the car instead of the go bike, because sometimes they're not very good drivers when they're driving with someone on the back. It's a bit safer to use the go bike. Well, grab and go check. It's very common that people will use the bike here, but from my experience, it'd be better just to pay the little bit extra and use the car. Since you're only here for nine days, it's, like, just a little bit more to use the car instead. But if you drive the bike yourself, this is okay because you know how to do it.", 'speaker B: Yes.', 'speaker A: So you want to surf? Have you surfed before, or is this your first time?', 'speaker B: I want to learn surfing.', "speaker A: You want to learn surfing? Yeah. There's many schools. I'm sure if you're just at the beach, I'm sure someone will try to convince you. Yes. I'm a great surfer. You should just research. Like, I would just google best surf spots in Ulawatu, and I'm sure a million spots will come up, and there's probably places you can stay. And the surf school is connected, if that was your priority, yes. So you're planning to go in December? Will you come back for Christmas, or will you be here for Christmas? Or do you celebrate Christmas? Is it, like, important there? No, it's not that important here either, as well. How long have you been on cambly for?", 'speaker B: Take a guess.', "speaker A: I have no idea. This is actually my first day on. Taught on. It's your first day as day? Yeah, it's my first day. I taught on other platforms before, but they were, like, structured classes where you have to follow very specific things.", "speaker B: It's the first day on camel, and I picked you.", "speaker A: Before, I was teaching, like, I've taught English on other platforms, but then I also have taught yoga for.", 'speaker B: Yoga?', 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Yoga online?', 'speaker A: No, in person, mostly. I taught in India for five years, and then I taught in Thailand, and then I taught here in Bali and in the States.', 'speaker B: You taught yoga in India?', 'speaker A: Yeah, that was my main job for five years.', "speaker B: I used to practice and yoga for about. I don't remember many years.", 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: And I was good at yoga, but since I stopped practice. How do you say that?', 'speaker A: Flexibility.', 'speaker B: Yeah, not so good. I like yoga.', "speaker A: Yeah, I used to do it a lot more as well. I've done it less, but still trying to. My recommendation, if you stopped, is to just try to do, like, 15 minutes a day. It makes a big difference. If you just do a little bit each day, then getting back in is much easier. Doing 1 hour or 2 hours is difficult sometimes when you haven't done it in a while.", "speaker B: 15 minutes. I'm learning dancing now.", 'speaker A: Oh, very cool. What type of dancing?', "speaker B: It's chinese traditional dance.", 'speaker A: Awesome. How long have you been doing that for?', 'speaker B: One and a half year.', 'speaker A: Oh, awesome. Have you ever traveled to India?', 'speaker B: No. It was my plan in 2020, but I have done the visa, and it was for one year.', "speaker A: And then Covid happened. Yeah. I was in India from 2012 until 2017. I spent most of my time there during that time. And then in the off seasons when I wasn't teaching, I would stay in Thailand most of the time.", 'speaker B: You mean sometimes you were India, and.', "speaker A: Sometimes you were, like, three quarters of the time in India and then a quarter of the time in Thailand. Because the school I was teaching for a teacher training course, and so we wouldn't have courses, like, nonstop. We had, like, four or five courses a year. So then sometimes I would go to Thailand, and when I was in Thailand, that's when I was teaching English online. I miss India, though. It's very nice. I don't know how it is now, though. I haven't been there since the end of 2017. A lot probably has changed.", 'speaker B: Yes.', 'speaker A: 2017, like a different lifetime. Yeah.', 'speaker B: Yes. Five years ago.', 'speaker A: Yeah. Even here feels like a very different place than four years ago.', 'speaker B: Which country do you like the most?', "speaker A: There's a couple that are, like, my favorites, like India, Thailand and Bali are probably my favorites, but for very different reasons. Here, driving is my favorite. I can't really drive in Thailand where here, there's no rules. You just drive around in Thailand, you need a license, and they have proper. But here it's just like, kind of. And then India is very nice because it's very cheap. And also you can just kind of walk everywhere in the city that I was staying in. So the localization was very nice that you can just get to everywhere. It's hard to pick one. Only good answer. One of the cool things if you come here, if you do travel around, though, is that I've never been to a place where city changes to jungle so fast. Like in know, if you're in Chiang Mai, you're in the city and there's very lush jungle, but you have to really go outside here, you could be in the city and in minutes, all of a sudden, boom, there's just rice patty fields in every direction and it's like, or boom, you're in the jungle. And that's probably my favorite thing about this island. I've never been to a place that has that shape shifting. It just looks completely different going up north, especially. So south has the best beaches, best for surfing. But up north, the views, the feeling of the mountains, and everything is special. I don't think I've been to a place that has that same look. Hopefully you can see it as well. When you're able to come here. If you're able to come, when will you find out if you can get the time off from work? When will you know if you can get the days off from work?", "speaker B: I don't know. The new boss will come here. Maybe in December. Hell, no. Not sure. I'm not sure. My friends are waiting for me.", "speaker A: Yeah, I recommend, if you really want to surf, spend at least four days down in Ulawatsu, even if you have to do it by yourself, if your friends want to roam around.

**User:** `
                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```

                       下面是我们的对话,你需要对每一轮都提出建议和标记，
                       如果觉得不需要修改authentic_expression可以为none，tags打上CORRECT即可
                       你返回的json文本中应该包括了我所有给你的对话内容

It was like a joke because I made a joke because I sent you a message and I just unsend it. So I felt like, oh no, now again, if I do something wrong, I can't unsend it. So that's why I said you liked it. It was a joke.", 'speaker B: Yeah. I can get it. And I just want to share you with this.', "speaker A: Don't worry. I don't want to meet another Chinese because you are one of a kind, so don't want to meet other Chinese.", 'speaker B: There are so many people more. Excellent. I think you will meet more Chinese in England and maybe you will have different opinion. About.', "speaker A: What I have learned since my childhood is that when you have a time with somebody now, just enjoy it and stop thinking about what will happen in the future. So I'm just saying things which I feel now. And you have to know that whatever I say, I mean it, because right now I say things for you. So in this moment, you feel special. It's about the future if I meet them or not in the future. But now is the present moment, and you have to enjoy the present moment.", "speaker B: Oh, I got what you mean. It's really precious. And I want to have this ability.", "speaker A: I learned it from my british teacher. He was from Dorset, England. He was my english teacher and literature teacher. So I got this idea from him. He used to say, always enjoy the present moment in time and the people around you don't think about the future. Like, you will have this type of people or this type of person you will meet. So right now, enjoy the thing because you have it. Maybe next time you might not have them. Enjoy fully.", 'speaker B: Yeah. I think in this way in my own brain, but maybe sometimes when I talk something, I may see some words, like just what I said before.', "speaker A: Actually, I don't do this to everybody. It's only for people who I know. For people who I feel like they are worth something, I get to learn something from them. They are unique. So I just say things which I feel like. Not for everybody. I just say like this, like how I say to you.", "speaker B: That's true. I think this is not just a choice, but an ability needed to learn. And I'm still on the way.", "speaker A: Absolutely. I was very fascinated when you went to a small detail of the soul which you sent me. I was like, whoa, whoa. She is extraordinary. She is so similar to me. I was like, wow. She sees small things. This kind of ability I have not seen in anybody else. You're the first one or maybe second one. I don't know. I've seen very rare. It's very rare that I've seen people who observe the small things.", "speaker B: It's lucky for us both.", "speaker A: Absolutely. I'm listening to that song you can hear.", "speaker B: Not everyone can appreciate it or just look finite. It's precious as well.", "speaker A: Absolutely. I agree that. But those people, they don't critically or analytically think. So that's what the problem lies like most of the people. So example, they don't know how to conversate maybe or say something. The previous day I met an arabic language partner and I told them, can you try to be more creative and say things in English more often because it'll help you out in improving your English. They said, I don't know how to be creative.", 'speaker B: Okay. I said in my personal.', "speaker A: And I told them, you can talk about anything about. I gave them topics about their hobies or stuff, but still they're not able to do it. So I think this type of quality only some people has.", 'speaker B: I got it. Maybe your thought about him is true, but in my perspective, I think the relationship between human is really complicated. Maybe he has, but he can show that to you. Do you know what I mean?', "speaker A: Yeah, I understand you. It's complicated. Different types of people are. I read a book about psychology of human beings and I see that only certain types of people are compatible with certain types of people.", "speaker B: Yeah. And I think everyone is growing and the speed of growth is really different. Maybe two years ago I'm not what I am. I was not what I am now. It's amazing. So the timing and the character personality is also important in human connection. It's really important. Yeah, it's amazing. Harder to describe. So overall it's really a luck actually.", "speaker A: I understand what you say. Yeah, that's a good analyst thinking you have really. That's a good one. But also I think on a fact that because right now when you're meeting somebody, example that is you, or if I'm meeting somebody else from some arab country, you would see the present one, you would not be able to wait for two years to see how the person will change.", 'speaker B: Pardon?', 'speaker A: Now, if you meet a person for the first time, okay.', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: See the present person, you'll see the present personality.", 'speaker B: A little.', 'speaker A: What little?', "speaker B: Yeah. As for me, I think I have different, how to say, different egos or different faces. I don't know how to express. When I am with different people, I will show different situation. So I think it's hard to feel someone's personality for the first time.", "speaker A: I'm not talking about the first time. I never said first time. I'm saying is that when you know a person for a while I'm talking about this. And when the person, if you know for a while and you know that this person is too different from you, so will you be able to wait for this person for many years to change. Even after you help them out and try them to change. Will you be able to do this? I'm asking you.", 'speaker B: I know what you are talking about. Maybe we are different.', "speaker A: I'll give you one example. I used to have a friend, okay? She really likes me so much. Just an example. Okay. But the thing is that she is not creative. She don't know how to talk. She can't start a conversation. I have tried from my end to ask her to start a conversation. I have given a lot of steps and books, but she can't still do it. I think it's in her personality. Now you are the person who always have to start a conversation. And now the person is not ready to change even after your efforts. So what is your thinking behind it? What are you going to do in this situation? This is an example. Okay. I made an example for you.", "speaker B: I think maybe because we are different, critical thinking is really important for you to make someone as your friend. But for me maybe it's not. But when it turns to the characteristic which I focus a lot, I think the answer is also different. When I meet someone, he is very different from me. And even sometimes he lack of the characteristic which I focus a lot. I think it's also nice to see different, to see diversity. It's also nice. Maybe he lacks this characteristic, but he has another I never feel or I never recognize before. I think it's also precious. And I think we can get along with Will as well. So I think it doesn't matter. But just for a friend, or for a classmate, a colleague, when it turns to a partner, maybe the answer is different, but only just for the friends. It's okay to get along with many, many different people.", "speaker A: Actually, since I've been preparing for Cambridge since last year, I learned a lot of things. I was like you, like you, how you're thinking now. I used to think like this before. But since I've been preparing for Cambridge to Oxford, like Cambridge, Oxford, I got to learn about critical thinking and analytical thinking in more in depth. It was very in depth. Like I learned the books. I learned a lot of books. I have read a lot of videos. And the way interview was there, the way how I communicated, the way the interview will take place. All of these gave me an idea of how critical analysis is important. When you be with a partner or a friend also.", 'speaker B: You understand me. I understand. I understand you a lot.', "speaker A: Yeah, I understand what you're saying. I'm saying is that when you have somebody who is. If you have a partner. Maybe just an example. Okay. If you have a partner who has a critical thinking, then this partner can be so helpful for you. If you can't do a critical thinking in the time where you can't make a good decision, this partner can come for a rescue because of their thinking. This partner can give you ideas and everything like they can critically think. It will be like a good balance of each other. An example, if there is example, you got caught somewhere with some drugs or something. Maybe I'll give you an example of United States. If you get caught with drugs or something. If you have a partner or if you have good analytical skills, you'll be able to explain it more clearly and your sentence for the prison or the punishment will be less. But example, if I saw a video on YouTube, a person who has bad analytical thinking has gone to jail for one year. A person who had good analytical thinking in the survey has just gotten defined. I recently realized how important these skills are. I used to think the same. I don't care. I don't care about these things at first. But now when I think about everyday things every day, like when I be with a person who has more critical thinking and analytical thinking, I'll be able to communicate more and they will be too. Their ideas will be new. I can talk more. Imagine if a person is just being quiet and you have to start always the conversation. You will not be able to learn anything from them. Maybe little, maybe very little.", 'speaker B: But I got it.', 'speaker A: Okay, you say, let me finish.', 'speaker B: Okay.', "speaker A: I read it in a book that humans grow by learning by knowledge. So when you lack knowledge from a person you're with like a partner or something, because you'll spend most of the time with them. And when you don't get much of a knowledge as a person, you'll not.", 'speaker B: Be able to grow.', "speaker A: I used to have a japanese friend. She is in USA now and she studies astrophysics. One day she told me that if a human stops thinking, their brain will shrink and become small. I don't agree with what she said, but what I said her. My view was if humans stop thinking, they will lack a lot of skills. I said her. So our both thinking was something similar. Like she said, it'll shrink when you're getting older and older. So her perspective was different, but both were similar perspectives, saying that that will happen if you don't have more knowledge. So that's why I think from recent interaction from the University of Oxford, Cambridge, I got a lot of knowledge about things. So that's why I say this. But from your perspective. I don't want to change your perspective, but that's my perspective.", 'speaker B: I got it. I think every person is different. The difference between us may be mainly because you are a person who is outrovert you talk to.', "speaker A: Sorry for interrupting. I want to say, before you answer me, I want to say that when you're picking up a person, you have to pick up a person who would be worth it for you. That's what I'm saying.", 'speaker B: Okay, I got it.', "speaker A: I know different people are different. But you have a choice to choose who wants to be in your life, right? You choose it if you allow it. If you are like, no, I don't want to be with this person. Then this person will just be as a friend, that's all. They will not be more closer to you.", "speaker B: Let me organize my words. I think you have this opinion. It's a symbol of you are very kind and patient. When you choose a person, you think about a long term relation in your life. And you can chat, communicate and learn from each other for a long time.", 'speaker A: Right, sorry, one more time.', 'speaker B: I said, when you think about choose a person, you focus on why do I choose a person for friend, for language partner, for partner, or something else? For every reason. Choose someone, pick up someone. Your opinion is about a long term relation.', "speaker A: No, it's not about long term. It's about short term to long term. Or maybe short term or maybe long term. It can be anything.", 'speaker B: I think maybe because I guess long term more. So you focus more about how you communicate and if you can learn from each other and so on.', "speaker A: Short term in the sense, like my british teacher used to say, you have to always make friends with whom you can learn something. I don't know how much you will agree with it, but most of the time I agree with it because I've met a lot of people. I'm not saying that I've met always people. I learned from them something. No, I've met some people who were very rude, some people who were not able to understand anything. What I say. So I have met different types of people, but most of the people who impacted me is that from whom I learned something.", 'speaker B: I got it in this way. I think we are the same. When I have to see who impacted me most is absolutely those who own critical thinking or very excellent in his areas or so many areas. But in my.', "speaker A: You got me wrong. Actually what I was saying is that before I used to think like I can have friends with anybody. I can just make friends with anybody, like any random person, just make friends and be with them, talk to them, just enjoy. But recently from my recent interaction with the Cambridge University, I got to learn the skills and these skills have changed my perspective, how I make friends and how I interact with different people. That's what I'm saying. You understand what I'm saying?", "speaker B: I understand if I can use Chinese I can explain very clearly. But when it turns to English, it's a bit difficult. I want to think in different period of our life, our standard of picking up friends is changing. And I think how to say the basic reason behind it is seeking what we lack or what we long for. I think it's common. And as for you, in this recent period of you, you think critical thinking is the most important. So this become one of your standards.", "speaker A: And also analytically reasoning. You know what is analytical? Analytical, I'll explain you. Analytical thinking means when you say something, you give reason behind it. Like example, you say that's a dog. If that's a cat, you will not say that's a dog. You'll say that's a dog because it looks like a dog.", "speaker B: I don't know very clearly. Can you repeat it?", "speaker A: Do you know what's the meaning of analytical thinking?", 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Okay, good. I thought you don't know. Okay, go ahead.", "speaker B: I want to say. So you focus critical thinking a lot because in this recent period you long for this ability or you think it's really important. But as for me, there are many important things. So if someone has a certain characteristic which I long for, it will be okay to make friends with him. Actually, I think the relationship doesn't have a specific definition in my life I get to chat with different people and maybe.", 'speaker A: Have you been in a relationship before?', 'speaker B: Relationship means partner.', 'speaker A: Yeah.', "speaker B: I have to say. But now I think there is not a specific definition in my life. Maybe I chat with different people and spend some time with them, but it's hard for me to admit that she or he is my friend. Do you know, maybe I like observing human. When it turns to the standard of friends, it's a little high or difficult. So I don't have so many friends and I think another reason or maybe just difference between us, I guess you are an introvert person and communicating with others is a really important person. Extrovert. Communicating with others is an important part in your life and is a necessary way to learn learning something new.", 'speaker A: Maybe because maybe you study as a lawyer and also my field is regarding science and I study human beings. Maybe because of that I understand people much more efficiently compared to you, I guess.', 'speaker B: Efficiently.', "speaker A: Maybe I'm saying is that I study human beings. My major is studying of human beings.", "speaker B: I got it. Different major gives people different abilities. Just in my perspective. I guess communicating with others is really important for you. And the ability of picking up human or knowing them is more stronger for you. But maybe I'm an introvert person and I used to. Staying alone and chatting with others is a way for me to observe human more. Not important way to get friends. It's not really important to me. It's harder to describe.", 'speaker A: I see.', 'speaker B: Maybe when I English is much better. I will explain again to you.', "speaker A: That's okay. Let's change topic now for 510 minutes and we can vote something. So you start a conversation with me about any topic you wish about this topic. And now you can start about anything.", "speaker B: As I said, I watched the cross dark eling limited today. And I'm very curious about the funeral in your country.", 'speaker A: This is in somewhere north of my country. It is not of my country. I stay in south.', "speaker B: Funeral isn't right. Funeral? Yeah, there are two funerals in that movie, so I'm a little curious about it.", 'speaker A: What is it? I have no idea. Tell me. A load break.', 'speaker B: Funeral is funeral when someone died, dead. And the others will do something for him.', 'speaker A: Like once.', 'speaker B: Have you ever attended one?', "speaker A: Yes, I have attended one funeral. One or two have it. Tell me more about what exactly you're talking about. What kind of funeral? Over here in my city, we bury the person in the ground.", 'speaker B: Oh, in the ground? Not fire?', 'speaker A: No.', 'speaker B: Oh, I got it. In my hometown, just my hometown, a very small city. We buried the person in the ground as well. But maybe in China, fire is more popular. Yeah. And actually, what I focus on is about the attitude to death in your city. To death? To death.', 'speaker A: Okay. Like, what do you mean by attitude to death?', "speaker B: If someone died, what other people think about that. It's a really bad thing and they will do something to do.

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"Suggestion": {"title": "Suggestion", "description": "\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u6807\u8bb0", "type": "array", "items": {"$ref": "#/definitions/Revision"}}}, "required": ["Suggestion"], "definitions": {"Revision": {"title": "Revision", "type": "object", "properties": {"Round": {"title": "Round", "description": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6570", "type": "string"}, "speaker_A": {"title": "Speaker A", "description": "speaker A \u7684\u539f\u8868\u8fbe", "type": "string"}, "speaker_B": {"title": "Speaker B", "description": "speaker B \u7684\u539f\u8868\u8fbe", "type": "string"}, "authentic_expression": {"title": "Authentic Expression", "description": "\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684authentic expression", "type": "string"}, "tags": {"title": "Tags", "description": "{\n                                            CORRECT\n                                            POLITENESS_USAGE \n                                            SENTENCE_STRUCTURE_ERROR \n                                            WORD_USAGE_ERROR \n                                            SENTENCE_SEQUENCE_ERROR\n                                            TENSE_ERROR\n                                            VOICE_ERROR\n                                            MODAL_VERB_ERROR \n                                            PRONOUN_AGREEMENT_ERROR \n                                            GRAMMAR\n                                            VOCABULARY\n                                            CLARITY_AND_FLUENCY\n                                        }\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u8005\u591a\u4e2a", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["Round", "speaker_A", "speaker_B", "authentic_expression", "tags"]}}}

Because Chinese is a tonal language, you use tones to say what you want to say. In English, we don't do that as much.

Height 3715 meters tall. Hang on. Google so it is this 3715. Now, it's not like Mount Everest, which is in space, but it's still pretty tall. It is.

Ten days after.', 'speaker A: So the 3 November or something like that. I think the 2 November. Cheap.', "speaker B: Ten days? Oh, no, it's not ten days. It's the 4 November.", 'speaker A: The 4 November. Okay.', 'speaker B: 15Th.', 'speaker A: Very good. Are you planning to do anything fun for your birthday?', 'speaker B: I like to, but I was planning to have a vacation or holiday in other country.', 'speaker A: Where would you like to go?', "speaker B: Indonesia.

I think there's a monsoon season for a few months. I think I would hate that.", 'speaker B: You hate that?', "speaker A: I think so. Because in Ireland it rains a lot. But we don't have like a monsoon season in Ireland, you know what I mean? But there is like constant rain for like three or four months. I go crazy. I go crazy. I'm going to live in China. When it's monsoon season, I'll come and live in China and you can take me. You have a monsoon season in China?

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```

['speaker A: You. How are you?', 'speaker B: Nice day, I think.', 'speaker A: How are you?', "speaker B: Actually? I'm fine. And maybe a nice day. What about you?", "speaker A: I'm fine too. When I'm talking to you, I'm just laughing a lot. You make me laugh. I'm fine too.", 'speaker B: Maybe just because you are a person who likes laughing a lot.', "speaker A: Okay. Yeah. I'm a very humorous person. I laugh all the comments. Even when I'm sad. I like to laugh even though it's a huge situation, a big situation. I make fun of it and I laugh.", 'speaker B: Oh, got it.', "speaker A: Yeah. I was talking to my uncle the other day and I didn't select. I was not selected in Cambridge, so I laughed and I told him I think that's my personality, I guess.", "speaker B: Yeah, maybe different people have a different opinion. And I think sometimes I'm similar to you, but sometimes I maybe prefer to keep silent.", "speaker A: Yeah. I think it's normal in girls because girls are very emotional, so that's okay.", 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: I read it in a book that girls are more emotional than the boys. So that's okay. Because you're on period. So that's okay. You have pain. Is it correct? When you're on periods, you became silent?", 'speaker B: Pardon?', 'speaker A: When you are on the period period, like on the menstruation cycle.', 'speaker B: Okay, I got it.', 'speaker A: You become silent.', "speaker B: I don't think it has some connections.", "speaker A: But you said you become silent, so you become silent when you're on period.", 'speaker B: They are not. How to say.', 'speaker A: Not in periods.', 'speaker B: They are independent. Maybe sometimes or maybe not. Sometimes there is not relevance or any connections.', 'speaker A: You sent me a message. If you meet other Chinese in the future, I suggest you not to say like this.', 'speaker B: Can you tell me more about this expression?', 'speaker A: Which expression?', "speaker B: I hope I don't misunderstand. You say you hope me to update my software because it will be hassle for you and you see. Do you want me to see you in hassle? I can get what's your meaning? And that's okay and more like kidding. But in Chinese, especially when among colleagues or classmates, friends or partners, some people will consider this as a guilt tripping. It seems like you want someone to do something for you for your benefit. So maybe some Chinese don't like this.", "speaker A: Okay, but that was like a joke. It was like a joke because I made a joke because I sent you a message and I just unsend it. So I felt like, oh no, now again, if I do something wrong, I can't unsend it. So that's why I said you liked it. It was a joke.", 'speaker B: Yeah. I can get it. And I just want to share you with this.', "speaker A: Don't worry. I don't want to meet another Chinese because you are one of a kind, so don't want to meet other Chinese.", 'speaker B: There are so many people more. Excellent. I think you will meet more Chinese in England and maybe you will have different opinion. About.', "speaker A: What I have learned since my childhood is that when you have a time with somebody now, just enjoy it and stop thinking about what will happen in the future. So I'm just saying things which I feel now. And you have to know that whatever I say, I mean it, because right now I say things for you. So in this moment, you feel special. It's about the future if I meet them or not in the future. But now is the present moment, and you have to enjoy the present moment.", "speaker B: Oh, I got what you mean. It's really precious. And I want to have this ability.", "speaker A: I learned it from my british teacher. He was from Dorset, England. He was my english teacher and literature teacher. So I got this idea from him. He used to say, always enjoy the present moment in time and the people around you don't think about the future. Like, you will have this type of people or this type of person you will meet. So right now, enjoy the thing because you have it. Maybe next time you might not have them. Enjoy fully.", 'speaker B: Yeah. I think in this way in my own brain, but maybe sometimes when I talk something, I may see some words, like just what I said before.', "speaker A: Actually, I don't do this to everybody. It's only for people who I know. For people who I feel like they are worth something, I get to learn something from them. They are unique. So I just say things which I feel like. Not for everybody. I just say like this, like how I say to you.", "speaker B: That's true. I think this is not just a choice, but an ability needed to learn. And I'm still on the way.", "speaker A: Absolutely. I was very fascinated when you went to a small detail of the soul which you sent me. I was like, whoa, whoa. She is extraordinary. She is so similar to me. I was like, wow. She sees small things. This kind of ability I have not seen in anybody else. You're the first one or maybe second one. I don't know. I've seen very rare. It's very rare that I've seen people who observe the small things.", "speaker B: It's lucky for us both.", "speaker A: Absolutely. I'm listening to that song you can hear.", "speaker B: Not everyone can appreciate it or just look finite. It's precious as well.", "speaker A: Absolutely. I agree that. But those people, they don't critically or analytically think. So that's what the problem lies like most of the people. So example, they don't know how to conversate maybe or say something. The previous day I met an arabic language partner and I told them, can you try to be more creative and say things in English more often because it'll help you out in improving your English. They said, I don't know how to be creative.", 'speaker B: Okay. I said in my personal.', "speaker A: And I told them, you can talk about anything about. I gave them topics about their hobies or stuff, but still they're not able to do it. So I think this type of quality only some people has.", 'speaker B: I got it. Maybe your thought about him is true, but in my perspective, I think the relationship between human is really complicated. Maybe he has, but he can show that to you. Do you know what I mean?', "speaker A: Yeah, I understand you. It's complicated. Different types of people are. I read a book about psychology of human beings and I see that only certain types of people are compatible with certain types of people.", "speaker B: Yeah. And I think everyone is growing and the speed of growth is really different. Maybe two years ago I'm not what I am. I was not what I am now. It's amazing. So the timing and the character personality is also important in human connection. It's really important. Yeah, it's amazing. Harder to describe. So overall it's really a luck actually.", "speaker A: I understand what you say. Yeah, that's a good analyst thinking you have really. That's a good one. But also I think on a fact that because right now when you're meeting somebody, example that is you, or if I'm meeting somebody else from some arab country, you would see the present one, you would not be able to wait for two years to see how the person will change.", 'speaker B: Pardon?', 'speaker A: Now, if you meet a person for the first time, okay.', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: See the present person, you'll see the present personality.", 'speaker B: A little.', 'speaker A: What little?', "speaker B: Yeah. As for me, I think I have different, how to say, different egos or different faces. I don't know how to express. When I am with different people, I will show different situation. So I think it's hard to feel someone's personality for the first time.", "speaker A: I'm not talking about the first time. I never said first time. I'm saying is that when you know a person for a while I'm talking about this. And when the person, if you know for a while and you know that this person is too different from you, so will you be able to wait for this person for many years to change. Even after you help them out and try them to change. Will you be able to do this? I'm asking you.", 'speaker B: I know what you are talking about. Maybe we are different.', "speaker A: I'll give you one example. I used to have a friend, okay? She really likes me so much. Just an example. Okay. But the thing is that she is not creative. She don't know how to talk. She can't start a conversation. I have tried from my end to ask her to start a conversation. I have given a lot of steps and books, but she can't still do it. I think it's in her personality. Now you are the person who always have to start a conversation. And now the person is not ready to change even after your efforts. So what is your thinking behind it? What are you going to do in this situation? This is an example. Okay. I made an example for you.", "speaker B: I think maybe because we are different, critical thinking is really important for you to make someone as your friend. But for me maybe it's not. But when it turns to the characteristic which I focus a lot, I think the answer is also different. When I meet someone, he is very different from me. And even sometimes he lack of the characteristic which I focus a lot. I think it's also nice to see different, to see diversity. It's also nice. Maybe he lacks this characteristic, but he has another I never feel or I never recognize before. I think it's also precious. And I think we can get along with Will as well. So I think it doesn't matter. But just for a friend, or for a classmate, a colleague, when it turns to a partner, maybe the answer is different, but only just for the friends. It's okay to get along with many, many different people.", "speaker A: Actually, since I've been preparing for Cambridge since last year, I learned a lot of things. I was like you, like you, how you're thinking now. I used to think like this before. But since I've been preparing for Cambridge to Oxford, like Cambridge, Oxford, I got to learn about critical thinking and analytical thinking in more in depth. It was very in depth. Like I learned the books. I learned a lot of books. I have read a lot of videos. And the way interview was there, the way how I communicated, the way the interview will take place. All of these gave me an idea of how critical analysis is important. When you be with a partner or a friend also.", 'speaker B: You understand me. I understand. I understand you a lot.', "speaker A: Yeah, I understand what you're saying. I'm saying is that when you have somebody who is. If you have a partner. Maybe just an example. Okay. If you have a partner who has a critical thinking, then this partner can be so helpful for you. If you can't do a critical thinking in the time where you can't make a good decision, this partner can come for a rescue because of their thinking. This partner can give you ideas and everything like they can critically think. It will be like a good balance of each other. An example, if there is example, you got caught somewhere with some drugs or something. Maybe I'll give you an example of United States. If you get caught with drugs or something. If you have a partner or if you have good analytical skills, you'll be able to explain it more clearly and your sentence for the prison or the punishment will be less. But example, if I saw a video on YouTube, a person who has bad analytical thinking has gone to jail for one year. A person who had good analytical thinking in the survey has just gotten defined. I recently realized how important these skills are. I used to think the same. I don't care. I don't care about these things at first. But now when I think about everyday things every day, like when I be with a person who has more critical thinking and analytical thinking, I'll be able to communicate more and they will be too. Their ideas will be new. I can talk more. Imagine if a person is just being quiet and you have to start always the conversation. You will not be able to learn anything from them. Maybe little, maybe very little.", 'speaker B: But I got it.', 'speaker A: Okay, you say, let me finish.', 'speaker B: Okay.', "speaker A: I read it in a book that humans grow by learning by knowledge. So when you lack knowledge from a person you're with like a partner or something, because you'll spend most of the time with them. And when you don't get much of a knowledge as a person, you'll not.", 'speaker B: Be able to grow.', "speaker A: I used to have a japanese friend. She is in USA now and she studies astrophysics. One day she told me that if a human stops thinking, their brain will shrink and become small. I don't agree with what she said, but what I said her. My view was if humans stop thinking, they will lack a lot of skills. I said her. So our both thinking was something similar. Like she said, it'll shrink when you're getting older and older. So her perspective was different, but both were similar perspectives, saying that that will happen if you don't have more knowledge. So that's why I think from recent interaction from the University of Oxford, Cambridge, I got a lot of knowledge about things. So that's why I say this. But from your perspective. I don't want to change your perspective, but that's my perspective.", 'speaker B: I got it. I think every person is different. The difference between us may be mainly because you are a person who is outrovert you talk to.', "speaker A: Sorry for interrupting. I want to say, before you answer me, I want to say that when you're picking up a person, you have to pick up a person who would be worth it for you. That's what I'm saying.", 'speaker B: Okay, I got it.', "speaker A: I know different people are different. But you have a choice to choose who wants to be in your life, right? You choose it if you allow it. If you are like, no, I don't want to be with this person. Then this person will just be as a friend, that's all. They will not be more closer to you.", "speaker B: Let me organize my words. I think you have this opinion. It's a symbol of you are very kind and patient. When you choose a person, you think about a long term relation in your life. And you can chat, communicate and learn from each other for a long time.", 'speaker A: Right, sorry, one more time.', 'speaker B: I said, when you think about choose a person, you focus on why do I choose a person for friend, for language partner, for partner, or something else? For every reason. Choose someone, pick up someone. Your opinion is about a long term relation.', "speaker A: No, it's not about long term. It's about short term to long term. Or maybe short term or maybe long term. It can be anything.", 'speaker B: I think maybe because I guess long term more. So you focus more about how you communicate and if you can learn from each other and so on.', "speaker A: Short term in the sense, like my british teacher used to say, you have to always make friends with whom you can learn something. I don't know how much you will agree with it, but most of the time I agree with it because I've met a lot of people. I'm not saying that I've met always people. I learned from them something. No, I've met some people who were very rude, some people who were not able to understand anything. What I say. So I have met different types of people, but most of the people who impacted me is that from whom I learned something.", 'speaker B: I got it in this way. I think we are the same. When I have to see who impacted me most is absolutely those who own critical thinking or very excellent in his areas or so many areas. But in my.', "speaker A: You got me wrong. Actually what I was saying is that before I used to think like I can have friends with anybody. I can just make friends with anybody, like any random person, just make friends and be with them, talk to them, just enjoy. But recently from my recent interaction with the Cambridge University, I got to learn the skills and these skills have changed my perspective, how I make friends and how I interact with different people. That's what I'm saying. You understand what I'm saying?", "speaker B: I understand if I can use Chinese I can explain very clearly. But when it turns to English, it's a bit difficult. I want to think in different period of our life, our standard of picking up friends is changing. And I think how to say the basic reason behind it is seeking what we lack or what we long for. I think it's common. And as for you, in this recent period of you, you think critical thinking is the most important. So this become one of your standards.", "speaker A: And also analytically reasoning. You know what is analytical? Analytical, I'll explain you. Analytical thinking means when you say something, you give reason behind it. Like example, you say that's a dog. If that's a cat, you will not say that's a dog. You'll say that's a dog because it looks like a dog.", "speaker B: I don't know very clearly. Can you repeat it?", "speaker A: Do you know what's the meaning of analytical thinking?", 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Okay, good. I thought you don't know. Okay, go ahead.", "speaker B: I want to say. So you focus critical thinking a lot because in this recent period you long for this ability or you think it's really important. But as for me, there are many important things. So if someone has a certain characteristic which I long for, it will be okay to make friends with him. Actually, I think the relationship doesn't have a specific definition in my life I get to chat with different people and maybe.", 'speaker A: Have you been in a relationship before?', 'speaker B: Relationship means partner.', 'speaker A: Yeah.', "speaker B: I have to say. But now I think there is not a specific definition in my life. Maybe I chat with different people and spend some time with them, but it's hard for me to admit that she or he is my friend. Do you know, maybe I like observing human. When it turns to the standard of friends, it's a little high or difficult. So I don't have so many friends and I think another reason or maybe just difference between us, I guess you are an introvert person and communicating with others is a really important person. Extrovert. Communicating with others is an important part in your life and is a necessary way to learn learning something new.", 'speaker A: Maybe because maybe you study as a lawyer and also my field is regarding science and I study human beings. Maybe because of that I understand people much more efficiently compared to you, I guess.', 'speaker B: Efficiently.', "speaker A: Maybe I'm saying is that I study human beings. My major is studying of human beings.", "speaker B: I got it. Different major gives people different abilities. Just in my perspective. I guess communicating with others is really important for you. And the ability of picking up human or knowing them is more stronger for you. But maybe I'm an introvert person and I used to. Staying alone and chatting with others is a way for me to observe human more. Not important way to get friends. It's not really important to me. It's harder to describe.", 'speaker A: I see.', 'speaker B: Maybe when I English is much better. I will explain again to you.', "speaker A: That's okay. Let's change topic now for 510 minutes and we can vote something. So you start a conversation with me about any topic you wish about this topic. And now you can start about anything.", "speaker B: As I said, I watched the cross dark eling limited today. And I'm very curious about the funeral in your country.", 'speaker A: This is in somewhere north of my country. It is not of my country. I stay in south.', "speaker B: Funeral isn't right. Funeral? Yeah, there are two funerals in that movie, so I'm a little curious about it.", 'speaker A: What is it? I have no idea. Tell me. A load break.', 'speaker B: Funeral is funeral when someone died, dead. And the others will do something for him.', 'speaker A: Like once.', 'speaker B: Have you ever attended one?', "speaker A: Yes, I have attended one funeral. One or two have it. Tell me more about what exactly you're talking about. What kind of funeral? Over here in my city, we bury the person in the ground.", 'speaker B: Oh, in the ground? Not fire?', 'speaker A: No.', 'speaker B: Oh, I got it. In my hometown, just my hometown, a very small city. We buried the person in the ground as well. But maybe in China, fire is more popular. Yeah. And actually, what I focus on is about the attitude to death in your city. To death? To death.', 'speaker A: Okay. Like, what do you mean by attitude to death?', "speaker B: If someone died, what other people think about that. It's a really bad thing and they will do something to do. What will they do to marimize him?", "speaker A: No, I didn't get to. Can you repeat one more time what?", 'speaker B: Let me organize my words. Okay.']`

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```

I'm listening to that song you can hear.", "speaker B: Not everyone can appreciate it or just look finite. It's precious as well.", "speaker A: Absolutely. I agree that.

The previous day I met an arabic language partner and I told them, can you try to be more creative and say things in English more often because it'll help you out in improving your English. They said, I don't know how to be creative.", 'speaker B: Okay. I said in my personal.', "speaker A: And I told them, you can talk about anything about. I gave them topics about their hobies or stuff, but still they're not able to do it. So I think this type of quality only some people has.", 'speaker B: I got it. Maybe your thought about him is true, but in my perspective, I think the relationship between human is really complicated. Maybe he has, but he can show that to you. Do you know what I mean?', "speaker A: Yeah, I understand you. It's complicated. Different types of people are. I read a book about psychology of human beings and I see that only certain types of people are compatible with certain types of people.", "speaker B: Yeah. And I think everyone is growing and the speed of growth is really different. Maybe two years ago I'm not what I am. I was not what I am now. It's amazing. So the timing and the character personality is also important in human connection. It's really important. Yeah, it's amazing. Harder to describe. So overall it's really a luck actually.", "speaker A: I understand what you say. Yeah, that's a good analyst thinking you have really. That's a good one. But also I think on a fact that because right now when you're meeting somebody, example that is you, or if I'm meeting somebody else from some arab country, you would see the present one, you would not be able to wait for two years to see how the person will change.", 'speaker B: Pardon?', 'speaker A: Now, if you meet a person for the first time, okay.', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: See the present person, you'll see the present personality.", 'speaker B: A little.', 'speaker A: What little?', "speaker B: Yeah. As for me, I think I have different, how to say, different egos or different faces. I don't know how to express. When I am with different people, I will show different situation. So I think it's hard to feel someone's personality for the first time.", "speaker A: I'm not talking about the first time. I never said first time. I'm saying is that when you know a person for a while I'm talking about this. And when the person, if you know for a while and you know that this person is too different from you, so will you be able to wait for this person for many years to change. Even after you help them out and try them to change. Will you be able to do this? I'm asking you.", 'speaker B: I know what you are talking about. Maybe we are different.', "speaker A: I'll give you one example. I used to have a friend, okay? She really likes me so much. Just an example. Okay. But the thing is that she is not creative. She don't know how to talk. She can't start a conversation. I have tried from my end to ask her to start a conversation. I have given a lot of steps and books, but she can't still do it. I think it's in her personality. Now you are the person who always have to start a conversation. And now the person is not ready to change even after your efforts. So what is your thinking behind it? What are you going to do in this situation? This is an example. Okay. I made an example for you.", "speaker B: I think maybe because we are different, critical thinking is really important for you to make someone as your friend. But for me maybe it's not. But when it turns to the characteristic which I focus a lot, I think the answer is also different. When I meet someone, he is very different from me. And even sometimes he lack of the characteristic which I focus a lot. I think it's also nice to see different, to see diversity. It's also nice. Maybe he lacks this characteristic, but he has another I never feel or I never recognize before. I think it's also precious. And I think we can get along with Will as well. So I think it doesn't matter. But just for a friend, or for a classmate, a colleague, when it turns to a partner, maybe the answer is different, but only just for the friends. It's okay to get along with many, many different people.", "speaker A: Actually, since I've been preparing for Cambridge since last year, I learned a lot of things. I was like you, like you, how you're thinking now. I used to think like this before. But since I've been preparing for Cambridge to Oxford, like Cambridge, Oxford, I got to learn about critical thinking and analytical thinking in more in depth. It was very in depth. Like I learned the books. I learned a lot of books. I have read a lot of videos. And the way interview was there, the way how I communicated, the way the interview will take place. All of these gave me an idea of how critical analysis is important. When you be with a partner or a friend also.", 'speaker B: You understand me. I understand. I understand you a lot.', "speaker A: Yeah, I understand what you're saying. I'm saying is that when you have somebody who is. If you have a partner. Maybe just an example. Okay. If you have a partner who has a critical thinking, then this partner can be so helpful for you. If you can't do a critical thinking in the time where you can't make a good decision, this partner can come for a rescue because of their thinking. This partner can give you ideas and everything like they can critically think. It will be like a good balance of each other. An example, if there is example, you got caught somewhere with some drugs or something. Maybe I'll give you an example of United States. If you get caught with drugs or something. If you have a partner or if you have good analytical skills, you'll be able to explain it more clearly and your sentence for the prison or the punishment will be less. But example, if I saw a video on YouTube, a person who has bad analytical thinking has gone to jail for one year. A person who had good analytical thinking in the survey has just gotten defined. I recently realized how important these skills are. I used to think the same. I don't care. I don't care about these things at first. But now when I think about everyday things every day, like when I be with a person who has more critical thinking and analytical thinking, I'll be able to communicate more and they will be too. Their ideas will be new. I can talk more. Imagine if a person is just being quiet and you have to start always the conversation. You will not be able to learn anything from them. Maybe little, maybe very little.", 'speaker B: But I got it.', 'speaker A: Okay, you say, let me finish.', 'speaker B: Okay.', "speaker A: I read it in a book that humans grow by learning by knowledge. So when you lack knowledge from a person you're with like a partner or something, because you'll spend most of the time with them. And when you don't get much of a knowledge as a person, you'll not.", 'speaker B: Be able to grow.', "speaker A: I used to have a japanese friend. She is in USA now and she studies astrophysics. One day she told me that if a human stops thinking, their brain will shrink and become small. I don't agree with what she said, but what I said her. My view was if humans stop thinking, they will lack a lot of skills. I said her. So our both thinking was something similar. Like she said, it'll shrink when you're getting older and older. So her perspective was different, but both were similar perspectives, saying that that will happen if you don't have more knowledge. So that's why I think from recent interaction from the University of Oxford, Cambridge, I got a lot of knowledge about things. So that's why I say this. But from your perspective. I don't want to change your perspective, but that's my perspective.", 'speaker B: I got it. I think every person is different. The difference between us may be mainly because you are a person who is outrovert you talk to.', "speaker A: Sorry for interrupting. I want to say, before you answer me, I want to say that when you're picking up a person, you have to pick up a person who would be worth it for you. That's what I'm saying.", 'speaker B: Okay, I got it.', "speaker A: I know different people are different. But you have a choice to choose who wants to be in your life, right? You choose it if you allow it. If you are like, no, I don't want to be with this person. Then this person will just be as a friend, that's all. They will not be more closer to you.", "speaker B: Let me organize my words. I think you have this opinion. It's a symbol of you are very kind and patient. When you choose a person, you think about a long term relation in your life. And you can chat, communicate and learn from each other for a long time.", 'speaker A: Right, sorry, one more time.', 'speaker B: I said, when you think about choose a person, you focus on why do I choose a person for friend, for language partner, for partner, or something else? For every reason. Choose someone, pick up someone. Your opinion is about a long term relation.', "speaker A: No, it's not about long term. It's about short term to long term. Or maybe short term or maybe long term. It can be anything.", 'speaker B: I think maybe because I guess long term more. So you focus more about how you communicate and if you can learn from each other and so on.', "speaker A: Short term in the sense, like my british teacher used to say, you have to always make friends with whom you can learn something. I don't know how much you will agree with it, but most of the time I agree with it because I've met a lot of people. I'm not saying that I've met always people. I learned from them something. No, I've met some people who were very rude, some people who were not able to understand anything. What I say. So I have met different types of people, but most of the people who impacted me is that from whom I learned something.", 'speaker B: I got it in this way. I think we are the same. When I have to see who impacted me most is absolutely those who own critical thinking or very excellent in his areas or so many areas. But in my.', "speaker A: You got me wrong. Actually what I was saying is that before I used to think like I can have friends with anybody. I can just make friends with anybody, like any random person, just make friends and be with them, talk to them, just enjoy. But recently from my recent interaction with the Cambridge University, I got to learn the skills and these skills have changed my perspective, how I make friends and how I interact with different people. That's what I'm saying. You understand what I'm saying?", "speaker B: I understand if I can use Chinese I can explain very clearly. But when it turns to English, it's a bit difficult. I want to think in different period of our life, our standard of picking up friends is changing. And I think how to say the basic reason behind it is seeking what we lack or what we long for. I think it's common. And as for you, in this recent period of you, you think critical thinking is the most important. So this become one of your standards.", "speaker A: And also analytically reasoning. You know what is analytical? Analytical, I'll explain you. Analytical thinking means when you say something, you give reason behind it. Like example, you say that's a dog. If that's a cat, you will not say that's a dog. You'll say that's a dog because it looks like a dog.", "speaker B: I don't know very clearly. Can you repeat it?", "speaker A: Do you know what's the meaning of analytical thinking?", 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Okay, good. I thought you don't know. Okay, go ahead.", "speaker B: I want to say. So you focus critical thinking a lot because in this recent period you long for this ability or you think it's really important. But as for me, there are many important things. So if someone has a certain characteristic which I long for, it will be okay to make friends with him. Actually, I think the relationship doesn't have a specific definition in my life I get to chat with different people and maybe.", 'speaker A: Have you been in a relationship before?', 'speaker B: Relationship means partner.', 'speaker A: Yeah.', "speaker B: I have to say. But now I think there is not a specific definition in my life. Maybe I chat with different people and spend some time with them, but it's hard for me to admit that she or he is my friend. Do you know, maybe I like observing human. When it turns to the standard of friends, it's a little high or difficult. So I don't have so many friends and I think another reason or maybe just difference between us, I guess you are an introvert person and communicating with others is a really important person. Extrovert. Communicating with others is an important part in your life and is a necessary way to learn learning something new.", 'speaker A: Maybe because maybe you study as a lawyer and also my field is regarding science and I study human beings. Maybe because of that I understand people much more efficiently compared to you, I guess.', 'speaker B: Efficiently.', "speaker A: Maybe I'm saying is that I study human beings. My major is studying of human beings.", "speaker B: I got it. Different major gives people different abilities. Just in my perspective. I guess communicating with others is really important for you. And the ability of picking up human or knowing them is more stronger for you. But maybe I'm an introvert person and I used to. Staying alone and chatting with others is a way for me to observe human more. Not important way to get friends. It's not really important to me. It's harder to describe.", 'speaker A: I see.', 'speaker B: Maybe when I English is much better. I will explain again to you.', "speaker A: That's okay. Let's change topic now for 510 minutes and we can vote something. So you start a conversation with me about any topic you wish about this topic. And now you can start about anything.", "speaker B: As I said, I watched the cross dark eling limited today. And I'm very curious about the funeral in your country.", 'speaker A: This is in somewhere north of my country. It is not of my country. I stay in south.', "speaker B: Funeral isn't right. Funeral? Yeah, there are two funerals in that movie, so I'm a little curious about it.", 'speaker A: What is it? I have no idea. Tell me. A load break.', 'speaker B: Funeral is funeral when someone died, dead. And the others will do something for him.', 'speaker A: Like once.', 'speaker B: Have you ever attended one?', "speaker A: Yes, I have attended one funeral. One or two have it. Tell me more about what exactly you're talking about. What kind of funeral? Over here in my city, we bury the person in the ground.", 'speaker B: Oh, in the ground? Not fire?', 'speaker A: No.', 'speaker B: Oh, I got it. In my hometown, just my hometown, a very small city. We buried the person in the ground as well. But maybe in China, fire is more popular. Yeah. And actually, what I focus on is about the attitude to death in your city. To death? To death.', 'speaker A: Okay. Like, what do you mean by attitude to death?', "speaker B: If someone died, what other people think about that. It's a really bad thing and they will do something to do.

to Oxford, like Cambridge, Oxford, I got to learn about critical thinking and analytical thinking in more in depth. It was very in depth. Like I learned the books. I learned a lot of books.

If you can't do a critical thinking in the time where you can't make a good decision, this partner can come for a rescue because of their thinking. This partner can give you ideas and everything like they can critically think. It will be like a good balance of each other. An example, if there is example, you got caught somewhere with some drugs or something. Maybe I'll give you an example of United States. If you get caught with drugs or something. If you have a partner or if you have good analytical skills, you'll be able to explain it more clearly and your sentence for the prison or the punishment will be less. But example, if I saw a video on YouTube, a person who has bad analytical thinking has gone to jail for one year. A person who had good analytical thinking in the survey has just gotten defined. I recently realized how important these skills are. I used to think the same. I don't care. I don't care about these things at first. But now when I think about everyday things every day, like when I be with a person who has more critical thinking and analytical thinking, I'll be able to communicate more and they will be too.

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```

                       下面是我们的对话,你需要对每一轮都提出建议和标记，
                       如果觉得不需要修改authentic_expression可以为none，tags打上CORRECT即可
                       你返回的json文本中应该包括了我所有给你的对话内容

People will go out like kind of like this kind of place.", 'speaker B: I know.', "speaker A: That's cool, too.", "speaker B: That's cool, too.", "speaker A: Yeah. I think that would be fun. But I think that part of the reason I think it's so boring to go figure like ice skating is because it's just like in a park and you just go in circles, right?

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```

How do you calculate that?', "speaker B: Calculate. I just know some basic rule. It mostly depends on when you win. You are the winner. When you win the last one, you draw.

And you win.", "speaker A: Oh, right. What do you call it? What's the other one? If you get it from other people.", 'speaker B: There are two situation. The people discard the key trails. If he had been doing Team PI. Team PI. It means there are just one tau. You can win.', "speaker A: If there's just one way that you could. Okay, okay.", "speaker B: You don't know Team pai. Teampai means you say team. And maybe there are different roles.", "speaker A: Yeah. That's another thing is that I think in Taiwan it's different because I know in Taiwan they also play with a different number of tiles.", 'speaker B: How many tiles? 1616.', "speaker A: Yeah. It's like.", 'speaker B: We are.', "speaker A: I'll show you what my hand was. For example, this was mine.", 'speaker B: Okay, I got.', "speaker A: So it's a little bit different. Right. And by the way, your sentence, you would say. This sentence you were trying to say is if you win off of someone's discard. Oh, sorry. I don't know what that punctuation is at the end, but that's the sentence you can say if you win off of someone's discard.", 'speaker B: So wing off. Wing off is a phrase if you.', "speaker A: Win off of something, it means you win because they did that. A longer way to say it is if you win off of someone's discarded tile.", "speaker B: Okay. If you win off of someone's discarded tile. Yeah.", "speaker A: But it's just longer. You don't need to say it like that. Yeah.

Last night I went to a social event with just friends, like people my age and these are friends that we usually hang out with. But everyone's drinking a lot of alcohol. And when people do that, it becomes really hard to understand them because they start using slang and swear words and their voice starts to go all like this. Even if you are like a chinese speaker still, sometimes when people are drunk, it's a little bit difficult. Sometimes when I go out, I get a little bit frustrated because I just want to have fun and make jokes. But I'm like, I don't even know what's going on?", 'speaker B: You cannot imagine.', "speaker A: Yeah, I cannot. People don't make sense, so it's really hard. It's really hard. And when people are hanging out with their friends, they want to sound cool, so they use their young friend voice. You know what I mean? Different words, different kind of voice.

Because I think if he attacked a rock, he will.', 'speaker A: Okay, hold on. Go back. You said, I wonder how he is.', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Dare is not the right word. You could say brave.

You said it's cool to watch videos of these people on TikTok, but have you seen the cool videos of figure skaters? These are professional ice skaters.", 'speaker B: Figure.', "speaker A: They are. They're like professional at ice skating. Do you know what I'm talking about?", 'speaker B: Two persons. A man, a woman.', "speaker A: It doesn't have to be two people. Yeah.", 'speaker B: In the circle field.', "speaker A: Well, it can be, but I'll show you. I follow a figure skater that goes to like, what do you say? Like, frozen lakes. And he does the figure skating on frozen lakes.", 'speaker B: Okay.', "speaker A: Yeah. Actually, I cannot find him, but I'll show you later. He's really cool. So people do that.

But I think that part of the reason I think it's so boring to go figure like ice skating is because it's just like in a park and you just go in circles, right? And then you just fall down and you laugh and you're like, oh, it's like, okay, now I'm just going to go home and I have a big bruise on my butt. And that's not cute. I don't know. But okay, in other years. Not this year, but in other years. Did you celebrate Valentine's Day?", 'speaker B: Other years? Yeah, we were in Lanzhou at that time.', "speaker A: Yeah, usually it's like a nice meal or something. Yeah. What about for the new year? I'm curious if the New Year's celebration, the Lunar New Year celebration, is different in China than it is in Taiwan. Do you have a day that you go to both sides of the family?", "speaker B: No, we are in different cities. We haven't been that state to meet each other.", 'speaker A: Okay, so what do you usually do?', "speaker B: I think it's boring. And the most important thing is to play the firewoods.", 'speaker A: Fireworks.', 'speaker B: Fireworks?', "speaker A: Yeah, fireworks. On New Year's Eve?", 'speaker B: What?', "speaker A: On New Year's Eve?", "speaker B: What's the meaning?", "speaker A: New Year's Eve is.", 'speaker B: Right.', "speaker A: Yeah. The day before New Year's Day.", 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Right. So, like, this year, New Year's Eve was on the 9th, February 9. This year. What is your Zodiac? Zodiac Nishuzama.", 'speaker B: Cough.', "speaker A: Not your year. So you just had a year, though? Yeah, a couple of years ago. Me too. Because I'm the mouse.", "speaker B: Your mouse. You're older than me one year.", "speaker A: Oh, I'm older than you one year.", 'speaker B: Right.', 'speaker A: I cannot calculate that. Okay.', 'speaker B: Hmm.', "speaker A: I didn't know that. I thought you were older than me, actually. Okay.", 'speaker B: I watched breaking bad, and I know how to say there is.']`

**User:** `
                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```

                       下面是我们的对话,你需要对每一轮都提出建议和标记，
                       如果觉得不需要修改authentic_expression可以为none，tags打上CORRECT即可
                       你返回的json文本中应该包括了我所有给你的对话内容

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

**User:** `
                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"Suggestion": {"title": "Suggestion", "description": "\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u6807\u8bb0", "type": "array", "items": {"$ref": "#/definitions/Revision"}}}, "required": ["Suggestion"], "definitions": {"Revision": {"title": "Revision", "type": "object", "properties": {"Round": {"title": "Round", "description": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6570", "type": "string"}, "speaker_A": {"title": "Speaker A", "description": "speaker A \u7684\u539f\u8868\u8fbe", "type": "string"}, "speaker_B": {"title": "Speaker B", "description": "speaker B \u7684\u539f\u8868\u8fbe", "type": "string"}, "authentic_expression": {"title": "Authentic Expression", "description": "\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684authentic expression", "type": "string"}, "tags": {"title": "Tags", "description": "{\n                                            CORRECT\n                                            POLITENESS_USAGE \n                                            SENTENCE_STRUCTURE_ERROR \n                                            WORD_USAGE_ERROR \n                                            SENTENCE_SEQUENCE_ERROR\n                                            TENSE_ERROR\n                                            VOICE_ERROR\n                                            MODAL_VERB_ERROR \n                                            PRONOUN_AGREEMENT_ERROR \n                                            GRAMMAR\n                                            VOCABULARY\n                                            CLARITY_AND_FLUENCY\n                                        }\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u8005\u591a\u4e2a", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["Round", "speaker_A", "speaker_B", "authentic_expression", "tags"]}}}

['speaker A: Hello.', 'speaker B: Hey. Hi, Leo. Can you see me?', 'speaker A: Right. Is this the first time we talking in the morning?', 'speaker B: Me?', 'speaker A: We?', "speaker B: Oh, us. Oh, really? I didn't think about that. Did you just wake up?", 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Why did you decide to start doing lessons in the morning.', 'speaker A: Before every day? We woke up at 10:00 a.m. This year I want to make it early, so I think schedule a lesson is a good way to make me wake up earlier.', 'speaker B: Okay. So usually you wake up at 10:00 a.m. You can have a Coca Cola at 09:00 a.m.?', 'speaker A: Right?', 'speaker B: Is that Coca Cola?', 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: At 09:00 a.m. I never saw that before. I never saw anyone drink soda with breakfast. Shocked. Do you feel like a lot of people drink Coca Cola in, in China? Is it really popular?', 'speaker A: Yeah, my team leader. Really?', "speaker B: Your team leader? Oh, so interesting. Okay. Oh, that's crazy. But what about coffee? You don't want coffee in the morning?", "speaker A: I don't because I have happy to have a nap at noon. Maybe it will influence it.", 'speaker B: So you have a nap and then after your nap you will have coffee.', 'speaker A: Right.', "speaker B: Interesting. Okay, I got it. What about like tea? You don't have any tea to help you wake up. Oh, I cannot see you.", 'speaker A: Hello?', 'speaker B: I cannot see you.', 'speaker A: Can you know.', "speaker B: Let me refresh. What about now? I think it's good. I can see you clearly now. Oh, no, you cannot hear me. Can you hear me? Right, okay, so you said you usually wake up at 10:00 a.m. But I want to know if you start waking up earlier, like at 830 or nine, then will you start going to sleep earlier?", "speaker A: Yeah, that's what I want to have. What time? 02:00 a.m. After. I know what you want to know.", 'speaker B: 02:00 a.m. But now what time will you start going to sleep?', 'speaker A: Midnight.', 'speaker B: Eight or nine.', 'speaker A: Midnight.', 'speaker B: Midnight. Midnight. Okay. When you say midnight, when you say mid, it sounds like you say need. So just try to make a short. I.', 'speaker A: Yeah, I know these things. Mid the night.', 'speaker B: Okay.', 'speaker A: Mid and I.', "speaker B: Okay, I understand. So like 8 hours of sleep or eight and a half hours of sleep. It's good, right? It's good. I feel like a lot of people have the problem for not getting enough sleep. I know a lot of people who only sleep 6 hours a night, but I just feel like I could not function if I did that. Are you the type of person that can get like 6 hours or 5 hours of sleep and still feel good?", 'speaker A: Yeah. All right. I think I am really?', 'speaker B: Okay. But it sounds like you still get more than 8 hours of sleep a night.', 'speaker A: No more than.', 'speaker B: Okay around 8 hours of sleep a night right? Yeah but in the past you had less sleep.', "speaker A: College 02:00 a.m. To 10:00 a.m. 8 hours it's still 8 hours but almost after 02:00 a.m..", "speaker B: Okay but when you stay awake until 02:00 a.m. Is it because you go out or you're at home staying awake until 02:00 a.m. At a home?", 'speaker A: Play the phone.', "speaker B: Just like using your phone? Yeah we don't usually say like play on our phone unless you can say like playing a game on my phone but we would just say like using my phone or sometimes we say something like scrolling. Scrolling means for example if I'm on. Yeah okay. Like social media and I just scroll scroll scroll scroll. This is scrolling and your page is like you could just do this for like an hour and you don't even know. Right? Yeah. Okay I got you. Nice. Okay so we're going to be doing morning lessons now. Good for you. It sounds difficult though. I started doing morning classes at like 08:00 a.m. Which I think for other people 08:00 a.m. Does not sound early but for me that means I have to wake up at 730 so it's really early for me. I don't like waking up so early.", "speaker A: Yeah what's the first thing after you wake up?", 'speaker B: Like what do I do? My morning routine.', 'speaker A: What team? Pardon?', 'speaker B: Morning routine?', "speaker A: Yeah what's her morning routine?", "speaker B: I usually get up and make my bed and then I drink warm water. One sway and then I get dressed and I don't do anything else. I check all my messages because when I'm sleeping it's the daytime in the US so usually when I wake up I have a lot of messages because it's people's daytime so then I will spend the time to respond to everything and then I just start teaching. So I already taught for like 1 hour. Yeah just finished 1 hour. Yeah but I'm not really a morning person like naturally I think maybe also not you.", "speaker A: Yeah when I went to work I just sit here pretend I'm working with further lunch.", "speaker B: Okay so afternoon you're more productive.", 'speaker A: All right.', "speaker B: But I am definitely the type of person who likes to eat breakfast. Many times I can skip lunch or skip dinner but I don't like to skip breakfast because I feel much better if I eat breakfast.", 'speaker A: Okay I never eat breakfast.', 'speaker B: Oh you never eat breakfast? Just Coca Cola?', "speaker A: No, it's not the routine.", 'speaker B: Okay.', 'speaker A: I just want to drink something. So I find a coca Cola in the refrigerator.', "speaker B: Sorry, it's just crazy to me. I could never drink that. Okay, so you never eat breakfast, right. Really? My sister is like that too, because.", "speaker A: In the college I got up later even more, maybe 11:00 so it's not sort of time to eat breakfast.", 'speaker B: But would you still eat when you woke up?', 'speaker A: I just eat lunch.', "speaker B: Yeah, but that's still like 1 hour after you wake up, so it's technically like your morning.", "speaker A: Yeah, but I maybe wash something. Okay. When I went to dining hall, it's.", "speaker B: I'm curious. I kind of know what the common breakfast is to have in Taiwan. But what are the common breakfast for people in, like, what do people usually.", 'speaker A: Have for breakfast in Beijing? In all the area of north China? The bald.', 'speaker B: Yotiao.', 'speaker A: Bald. And milk. Do you know dofano?', 'speaker B: Dofino.', "speaker A: Made of beans, but it's like dozen.", "speaker B: Okay. I don't know it. Dofa.", 'speaker A: No, tofu. Translation is.', "speaker B: Oh, you call it this. You don't call it dohua?", 'speaker A: Yeah. In the north we call it.', "speaker B: Oh, cool. I didn't know that. Okay, nice. Cool. This is really nice because actually a lot of places I go, they don't have the savory dohua. Usually people eat the sweet dohua here, but that looks really good. And then it's like protein in the morning.", 'speaker A: Yeah, protein enriched protein.', 'speaker B: But what do people put on top of doha? The tofu. For the breakfast, what is usually goes on top?', 'speaker A: A kind of sauce can make it salty.', 'speaker B: Salty?', "speaker A: Yeah. Otherwise it's like water.", "speaker B: Right. It's kind of like soy sauce. The sauce. Or like chili oil.", 'speaker A: Chili oil, how to spell it?', "speaker B: Yeah. Like chili oil. No, sorry, chili oil. Like this. Ah, the Sauce you talk about is from like meat, Ryan. Totally. Okay. Yeah, it has a lot of flavor. It's very salty. Okay, interesting. You know, a lot of people here, they just go out for breakfast, but actually, I think since food is expensive in the US, we cook a lot of our meals, so we'll make something fast at home. But I noticed most people here, they don't make breakfast. They'll go out and get something fast.", 'speaker A: Yeah. Some of my colleagues would do it by themselves in the morning. So fast. Breakfast.', 'speaker B: Do people eat like, manto?', 'speaker A: Manto is more common at noon. At lunch.', "speaker B: At lunch it's just bread. Okay, that's so funny. Okay. Are a lot of people concerned, like, in the US, we have a lot of different diet trends that people do. Are people in China very concerned with doing diets or. No.", "speaker A: What's the meaning of concerned? Diets pay more than.", "speaker B: No, what I mean is, I don't just mean, like, what they eat. I mean, like making a diet. Like, do people have diet plans in China? Often?", 'speaker A: Not common.', "speaker B: Yeah, it's not common. Okay. Yeah.", "speaker A: Because most people, I think most people don't have basic knowledge about nutrition. Actually, their knowledge about food is from the traditional medicine, I think. But they're not scientific.", "speaker B: Yeah, I know you don't like the chinese medicine. Okay. But I'm mostly wondering, because in the US, we have diet plans that are more like, we have one called Atkins diet, or there's types of diets where people count calories, which is really old. People don't do this so much now, but there's also one recently. This is the one I want to talk to you about. Recently, some Americans have been doing a carnivore diet. Have you heard about this.", 'speaker A: Carnival?', 'speaker B: No. We are all omnivores.', "speaker A: They don't eat the foods from plants. Not at all.", "speaker B: Not at all, bro. It's so weird.", "speaker A: I don't know why. Because if you want to distinguish the food from plants, it's also difficult, isn't it?", 'speaker B: No, because no pasta, no rice, no vegetables. They eat, like, beef and fish and butter. Butter. And they eat nothing else. Maybe eggs. Eggs. Eggs.', 'speaker A: Why do they go like this?', "speaker B: Because I'm telling you, this is a trend. Like a fad, right? People believe, they did a lot of research on diets, on healthy diets, and they believe that a very high protein and fat diet, and no carbs, no sugars, like these types of things. It's like an extreme diet. We would call this an extreme diet, but my aunt and my uncle have been doing this diet for a year, which means they have eaten nothing but meat and eggs and butter for a year.", 'speaker A: How does it affect.', 'speaker B: So, a lot of the time, the reason people do these diets is because they want to have the high muscle mass.', 'speaker A: Right?', "speaker B: High muscle mass and low fat. They don't want to have a lot of fat. So my auntie and my uncle, they lost a lot of weight. Yeah, a lot. They lost a lot of weight. But it's really weird because they kind of ignore the things that are not good that are happening. Like, for example, they cannot poop very well. And they're just like. It's because our body is adjusting or because we don't have a lot of vegetables.", 'speaker A: He cannot poop poop, poop.', 'speaker B: Go to the bathroom. Poop. Poop. Not pee. Poop. Go it.', 'speaker A: Okay, I got.', "speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, Dabian. They cannot poop because their digestive system is not good now anyway. Okay, so I was wondering, China doesn't have any weird diets or something that people try.", 'speaker A: The people in the room pay more attention on it.', 'speaker B: Who?', 'speaker A: Fitness in Jane.', 'speaker B: Fitness. Fitness.', 'speaker A: Fitness. Yeah.', 'speaker B: Like people who train at the. Okay, sure.', 'speaker A: Could this kind of exercise totally were from foreign countries. So all the theory are modern. So they focus on the diet. Actually.', 'speaker B: All of what is modern?', 'speaker A: The workout.', 'speaker B: The workout plan is like a modern workout plan. I never heard anyone say that.', 'speaker A: This kind of sport you work out from abroad.', 'speaker B: Crossfit.', 'speaker A: I search it.', "speaker B: It's like Crossfit. Okay, I think I know what you're talking about. Or maybe not. Or is it bodybuilding?", "speaker A: Yeah. Even the bar. What's the bar? Bell bar and stick bar? Yeah. All of them are abroad.", 'speaker B: You mean imported from abroad?', 'speaker A: Yeah, imported.', "speaker B: Okay, so you're just saying that they do, like, foreign style exercise plans.", 'speaker A: Diet plan and.', 'speaker B: Diet plan.', 'speaker A: Yeah. Okay. This kind of sport was imported. So the people getting involved in are not influenced by the traditional medicine. So they have the same modern diet theory.', "speaker B: Okay, I understand what you're saying. They don't subscribe to the traditional way of thinking. Okay.", 'speaker A: Yeah. And there is also a slogan that 30 percentage exercise and 70% age 18.', 'speaker B: 70% age 1818.', 'speaker A: Right. 70%.', "speaker B: Okay, I see what you're saying. Yeah. Do a lot of people do, like, protein shakes for that? Okay, I know that you work out sometimes. Do you do anything for your diet or do you just eat whatever you want and then exercise?", "speaker A: Coach, make a priority of gona diet about control the calorie, about your calories. Yeah. So I lost weight so fast, but someday he went to his hometown to get married, so there's nobody regulating me. So I went back again.", 'speaker B: Wait, how long has he been gone?', 'speaker A: Three months.', "speaker B: He's not coming back, right?", 'speaker A: Not in Beijing.', 'speaker B: You need a new trainer. We usually call this a trainer, not a coach.', 'speaker A: I found a trainer last night.', 'speaker B: You did? Nice.', 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Okay, cool. At the same gym?', 'speaker A: No, a new gym. A new gym around my.', "speaker B: Nice. So usually we'll say trainer for someone who's helping you go to the gym and train your body. Coach is more for like, for example, if you do like, a b side, if you're doing a competition, then you will have a coach to teach you how to prepare for that.", 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Just a little bit different. Yeah. Okay, so for your workouts, do you mostly do weightlifting or do you also do cardio weightlifting? Okay. Do you do stretching? Do you stretch? Oh, sorry. Go ahead.', 'speaker A: Yeah. After the weight lifting, maybe ten minute stretch is important.', "speaker B: Okay. Wait, you stretch for ten minutes? Oh, that's so good. My boyfriend will never stretch with me. I always tell him, you should stretch, and he skip it. He's like, I'm too lazy because I feel like men usually skip stretching and the women always stretch. You know what I mean? But it's important.", 'speaker A: It night. Patient. Patient. Women are more.', "speaker B: Yeah, when you say, don't say woman, you say women.", 'speaker A: Oh, yeah, women.', "speaker B: Okay. You do weightlifting. So do you usually do. I just want to go through some gym words with you that maybe you don't know. So are you doing endurance lifts like, you try to see how long you can go, or do you do power lifts? Do you know the difference?", 'speaker A: I. Power lift. Emphasize the maximum weight that you can lift.', 'speaker B: Yeah. Power lifts is the maximum weight you can do. And then maybe you just do a few of them, like maybe one, two, three.', 'speaker A: I think I prefer which one? Endurance. Yeah, endurance.', "speaker B: Yeah. I think it's better for you anyway because you're not preparing for, like, a competition or something. Same. Okay. Sorry. The time is running out. Have a good day. Bye."]`

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。

                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

This is scrolling and your page is like you could just do this for like an hour and you don't even know. Right? Yeah. Okay I got you. Nice. Okay so we're going to be doing morning lessons now. Good for you. It sounds difficult though. I started doing morning classes at like 08:00 a.m. Which I think for other people 08:00 a.m. Does not sound early but for me that means I have to wake up at 730 so it's really early for me. I don't like waking up so early.", "speaker A: Yeah what's the first thing after you wake up?", 'speaker B: Like what do I do? My morning routine.', 'speaker A: What team? Pardon?', 'speaker B: Morning routine?', "speaker A: Yeah what's her morning routine?", "speaker B: I usually get up and make my bed and then I drink warm water. One sway and then I get dressed and I don't do anything else. I check all my messages because when I'm sleeping it's the daytime in the US so usually when I wake up I have a lot of messages because it's people's daytime so then I will spend the time to respond to everything and then I just start teaching. So I already taught for like 1 hour. Yeah just finished 1 hour. Yeah but I'm not really a morning person like naturally I think maybe also not you.", "speaker A: Yeah when I went to work I just sit here pretend I'm working with further lunch.", "speaker B: Okay so afternoon you're more productive.", 'speaker A: All right.', "speaker B: But I am definitely the type of person who likes to eat breakfast. Many times I can skip lunch or skip dinner but I don't like to skip breakfast because I feel much better if I eat breakfast.", 'speaker A: Okay I never eat breakfast.', 'speaker B: Oh you never eat breakfast? Just Coca Cola?', "speaker A: No, it's not the routine.", 'speaker B: Okay.', 'speaker A: I just want to drink something. So I find a coca Cola in the refrigerator.', "speaker B: Sorry, it's just crazy to me. I could never drink that. Okay, so you never eat breakfast, right. Really? My sister is like that too, because.", "speaker A: In the college I got up later even more, maybe 11:00 so it's not sort of time to eat breakfast.", 'speaker B: But would you still eat when you woke up?', 'speaker A: I just eat lunch.', "speaker B: Yeah, but that's still like 1 hour after you wake up, so it's technically like your morning.", "speaker A: Yeah, but I maybe wash something. Okay. When I went to dining hall, it's.", "speaker B: I'm curious. I kind of know what the common breakfast is to have in Taiwan. But what are the common breakfast for people in, like, what do people usually.", 'speaker A: Have for breakfast in Beijing? In all the area of north China? The bald.', 'speaker B: Yotiao.', 'speaker A: Bald. And milk. Do you know dofano?', 'speaker B: Dofino.', "speaker A: Made of beans, but it's like dozen.", "speaker B: Okay. I don't know it. Dofa.", 'speaker A: No, tofu. Translation is.', "speaker B: Oh, you call it this. You don't call it dohua?", 'speaker A: Yeah. In the north we call it.', "speaker B: Oh, cool. I didn't know that. Okay, nice. Cool. This is really nice because actually a lot of places I go, they don't have the savory dohua. Usually people eat the sweet dohua here, but that looks really good. And then it's like protein in the morning.", 'speaker A: Yeah, protein enriched protein.', 'speaker B: But what do people put on top of doha? The tofu. For the breakfast, what is usually goes on top?', 'speaker A: A kind of sauce can make it salty.', 'speaker B: Salty?', "speaker A: Yeah. Otherwise it's like water.", "speaker B: Right. It's kind of like soy sauce. The sauce. Or like chili oil.", 'speaker A: Chili oil, how to spell it?', "speaker B: Yeah. Like chili oil. No, sorry, chili oil. Like this. Ah, the Sauce you talk about is from like meat, Ryan. Totally. Okay. Yeah, it has a lot of flavor. It's very salty. Okay, interesting. You know, a lot of people here, they just go out for breakfast, but actually, I think since food is expensive in the US, we cook a lot of our meals, so we'll make something fast at home. But I noticed most people here, they don't make breakfast. They'll go out and get something fast.", 'speaker A: Yeah. Some of my colleagues would do it by themselves in the morning. So fast. Breakfast.', 'speaker B: Do people eat like, manto?', 'speaker A: Manto is more common at noon. At lunch.', "speaker B: At lunch it's just bread. Okay, that's so funny. Okay. Are a lot of people concerned, like, in the US, we have a lot of different diet trends that people do. Are people in China very concerned with doing diets or. No.", "speaker A: What's the meaning of concerned? Diets pay more than.", "speaker B: No, what I mean is, I don't just mean, like, what they eat. I mean, like making a diet. Like, do people have diet plans in China? Often?", 'speaker A: Not common.', "speaker B: Yeah, it's not common. Okay. Yeah.", "speaker A: Because most people, I think most people don't have basic knowledge about nutrition. Actually, their knowledge about food is from the traditional medicine, I think. But they're not scientific.", "speaker B: Yeah, I know you don't like the chinese medicine. Okay. But I'm mostly wondering, because in the US, we have diet plans that are more like, we have one called Atkins diet, or there's types of diets where people count calories, which is really old. People don't do this so much now, but there's also one recently. This is the one I want to talk to you about. Recently, some Americans have been doing a carnivore diet. Have you heard about this.", 'speaker A: Carnival?', 'speaker B: No. We are all omnivores.', "speaker A: They don't eat the foods from plants. Not at all.", "speaker B: Not at all, bro. It's so weird.", "speaker A: I don't know why. Because if you want to distinguish the food from plants, it's also difficult, isn't it?", 'speaker B: No, because no pasta, no rice, no vegetables. They eat, like, beef and fish and butter. Butter. And they eat nothing else. Maybe eggs. Eggs. Eggs.', 'speaker A: Why do they go like this?', "speaker B: Because I'm telling you, this is a trend. Like a fad, right? People believe, they did a lot of research on diets, on healthy diets, and they believe that a very high protein and fat diet, and no carbs, no sugars, like these types of things. It's like an extreme diet. We would call this an extreme diet, but my aunt and my uncle have been doing this diet for a year, which means they have eaten nothing but meat and eggs and butter for a year.", 'speaker A: How does it affect.', 'speaker B: So, a lot of the time, the reason people do these diets is because they want to have the high muscle mass.', 'speaker A: Right?', "speaker B: High muscle mass and low fat. They don't want to have a lot of fat. So my auntie and my uncle, they lost a lot of weight. Yeah, a lot. They lost a lot of weight. But it's really weird because they kind of ignore the things that are not good that are happening. Like, for example, they cannot poop very well. And they're just like. It's because our body is adjusting or because we don't have a lot of vegetables.", 'speaker A: He cannot poop poop, poop.', 'speaker B: Go to the bathroom. Poop. Poop. Not pee. Poop. Go it.', 'speaker A: Okay, I got.', "speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, Dabian. They cannot poop because their digestive system is not good now anyway. Okay, so I was wondering, China doesn't have any weird diets or something that people try.", 'speaker A: The people in the room pay more attention on it.', 'speaker B: Who?', 'speaker A: Fitness in Jane.', 'speaker B: Fitness. Fitness.', 'speaker A: Fitness. Yeah.', 'speaker B: Like people who train at the. Okay, sure.', 'speaker A: Could this kind of exercise totally were from foreign countries.

All of them are abroad.", 'speaker B: You mean imported from abroad?', 'speaker A: Yeah, imported.', "speaker B: Okay, so you're just saying that they do, like, foreign style exercise plans.", 'speaker A: Diet plan and.', 'speaker B: Diet plan.', 'speaker A: Yeah. Okay. This kind of sport was imported. So the people getting involved in are not influenced by the traditional medicine. So they have the same modern diet theory.', "speaker B: Okay, I understand what you're saying. They don't subscribe to the traditional way of thinking. Okay.", 'speaker A: Yeah. And there is also a slogan that 30 percentage exercise and 70% age 18.', 'speaker B: 70% age 1818.', 'speaker A: Right. 70%.', "speaker B: Okay, I see what you're saying. Yeah. Do a lot of people do, like, protein shakes for that? Okay, I know that you work out sometimes. Do you do anything for your diet or do you just eat whatever you want and then exercise?", "speaker A: Coach, make a priority of gona diet about control the calorie, about your calories. Yeah. So I lost weight so fast, but someday he went to his hometown to get married, so there's nobody regulating me. So I went back again.", 'speaker B: Wait, how long has he been gone?', 'speaker A: Three months.', "speaker B: He's not coming back, right?", 'speaker A: Not in Beijing.', 'speaker B: You need a new trainer. We usually call this a trainer, not a coach.', 'speaker A: I found a trainer last night.', 'speaker B: You did? Nice.', 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Okay, cool. At the same gym?', 'speaker A: No, a new gym. A new gym around my.', "speaker B: Nice. So usually we'll say trainer for someone who's helping you go to the gym and train your body. Coach is more for like, for example, if you do like, a b side, if you're doing a competition, then you will have a coach to teach you how to prepare for that.", 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Just a little bit different. Yeah. Okay, so for your workouts, do you mostly do weightlifting or do you also do cardio weightlifting? Okay. Do you do stretching? Do you stretch? Oh, sorry. Go ahead.', 'speaker A: Yeah. After the weight lifting, maybe ten minute stretch is important.', "speaker B: Okay. Wait, you stretch for ten minutes? Oh, that's so good. My boyfriend will never stretch with me. I always tell him, you should stretch, and he skip it. He's like, I'm too lazy because I feel like men usually skip stretching and the women always stretch. You know what I mean? But it's important.", 'speaker A: It night. Patient. Patient. Women are more.', "speaker B: Yeah, when you say, don't say woman, you say women.", 'speaker A: Oh, yeah, women.', "speaker B: Okay. You do weightlifting. So do you usually do. I just want to go through some gym words with you that maybe you don't know. So are you doing endurance lifts like, you try to see how long you can go, or do you do power lifts? Do you know the difference?", 'speaker A: I. Power lift. Emphasize the maximum weight that you can lift.', 'speaker B: Yeah. Power lifts is the maximum weight you can do. And then maybe you just do a few of them, like maybe one, two, three.', 'speaker A: I think I prefer which one? Endurance. Yeah, endurance.', "speaker B: Yeah. I think it's better for you anyway because you're not preparing for, like, a competition or something. Same. Okay. Sorry. The time is running out. Have a good day. Bye."]`

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

['speaker A: Hello.', 'speaker B: Hey. Hi, Leo. Can you see me?', 'speaker A: Right. Is this the first time we talking in the morning?', 'speaker B: Me?', 'speaker A: We?', "speaker B: Oh, us. Oh, really? I didn't think about that. Did you just wake up?", 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Why did you decide to start doing lessons in the morning.', 'speaker A: Before every day? We woke up at 10:00 a.m. This year I want to make it early, so I think schedule a lesson is a good way to make me wake up earlier.', 'speaker B: Okay. So usually you wake up at 10:00 a.m. You can have a Coca Cola at 09:00 a.m.?', 'speaker A: Right?', 'speaker B: Is that Coca Cola?', 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: At 09:00 a.m. I never saw that before. I never saw anyone drink soda with breakfast. Shocked. Do you feel like a lot of people drink Coca Cola in, in China? Is it really popular?', 'speaker A: Yeah, my team leader. Really?', "speaker B: Your team leader? Oh, so interesting. Okay. Oh, that's crazy. But what about coffee? You don't want coffee in the morning?", "speaker A: I don't because I have happy to have a nap at noon. Maybe it will influence it.", 'speaker B: So you have a nap and then after your nap you will have coffee.', 'speaker A: Right.', "speaker B: Interesting. Okay, I got it. What about like tea? You don't have any tea to help you wake up. Oh, I cannot see you.", 'speaker A: Hello?', 'speaker B: I cannot see you.', 'speaker A: Can you know.', "speaker B: Let me refresh. What about now? I think it's good. I can see you clearly now. Oh, no, you cannot hear me. Can you hear me? Right, okay, so you said you usually wake up at 10:00 a.m. But I want to know if you start waking up earlier, like at 830 or nine, then will you start going to sleep earlier?", "speaker A: Yeah, that's what I want to have. What time? 02:00 a.m. After. I know what you want to know.", 'speaker B: 02:00 a.m. But now what time will you start going to sleep?', 'speaker A: Midnight.', 'speaker B: Eight or nine.', 'speaker A: Midnight.', 'speaker B: Midnight. Midnight. Okay. When you say midnight, when you say mid, it sounds like you say need. So just try to make a short. I.', 'speaker A: Yeah, I know these things. Mid the night.', 'speaker B: Okay.', 'speaker A: Mid and I.', "speaker B: Okay, I understand. So like 8 hours of sleep or eight and a half hours of sleep. It's good, right? It's good. I feel like a lot of people have the problem for not getting enough sleep. I know a lot of people who only sleep 6 hours a night, but I just feel like I could not function if I did that. Are you the type of person that can get like 6 hours or 5 hours of sleep and still feel good?", 'speaker A: Yeah. All right. I think I am really?', 'speaker B: Okay. But it sounds like you still get more than 8 hours of sleep a night.', 'speaker A: No more than.', 'speaker B: Okay around 8 hours of sleep a night right? Yeah but in the past you had less sleep.', "speaker A: College 02:00 a.m. To 10:00 a.m. 8 hours it's still 8 hours but almost after 02:00 a.m..", "speaker B: Okay but when you stay awake until 02:00 a.m. Is it because you go out or you're at home staying awake until 02:00 a.m. At a home?", 'speaker A: Play the phone.', "speaker B: Just like using your phone? Yeah we don't usually say like play on our phone unless you can say like playing a game on my phone but we would just say like using my phone or sometimes we say something like scrolling. Scrolling means for example if I'm on. Yeah okay. Like social media and I just scroll scroll scroll scroll. This is scrolling and your page is like you could just do this for like an hour and you don't even know. Right? Yeah. Okay I got you. Nice. Okay so we're going to be doing morning lessons now. Good for you. It sounds difficult though. I started doing morning classes at like 08:00 a.m. Which I think for other people 08:00 a.m. Does not sound early but for me that means I have to wake up at 730 so it's really early for me. I don't like waking up so early.", "speaker A: Yeah what's the first thing after you wake up?", 'speaker B: Like what do I do? My morning routine.', 'speaker A: What team? Pardon?', 'speaker B: Morning routine?', "speaker A: Yeah what's her morning routine?", "speaker B: I usually get up and make my bed and then I drink warm water. One sway and then I get dressed and I don't do anything else. I check all my messages because when I'm sleeping it's the daytime in the US so usually when I wake up I have a lot of messages because it's people's daytime so then I will spend the time to respond to everything and then I just start teaching. So I already taught for like 1 hour. Yeah just finished 1 hour. Yeah but I'm not really a morning person like naturally I think maybe also not you.", "speaker A: Yeah when I went to work I just sit here pretend I'm working with further lunch.", "speaker B: Okay so afternoon you're more productive.", 'speaker A: All right.', "speaker B: But I am definitely the type of person who likes to eat breakfast. Many times I can skip lunch or skip dinner but I don't like to skip breakfast because I feel much better if I eat breakfast.", 'speaker A: Okay I never eat breakfast.', 'speaker B: Oh you never eat breakfast? Just Coca Cola?', "speaker A: No, it's not the routine.", 'speaker B: Okay.', 'speaker A: I just want to drink something. So I find a coca Cola in the refrigerator.', "speaker B: Sorry, it's just crazy to me. I could never drink that. Okay, so you never eat breakfast, right. Really? My sister is like that too, because.", "speaker A: In the college I got up later even more, maybe 11:00 so it's not sort of time to eat breakfast.", 'speaker B: But would you still eat when you woke up?', 'speaker A: I just eat lunch.', "speaker B: Yeah, but that's still like 1 hour after you wake up, so it's technically like your morning.", "speaker A: Yeah, but I maybe wash something. Okay. When I went to dining hall, it's.", "speaker B: I'm curious. I kind of know what the common breakfast is to have in Taiwan. But what are the common breakfast for people in, like, what do people usually.", 'speaker A: Have for breakfast in Beijing? In all the area of north China? The bald.', 'speaker B: Yotiao.', 'speaker A: Bald. And milk. Do you know dofano?', 'speaker B: Dofino.', "speaker A: Made of beans, but it's like dozen.", "speaker B: Okay. I don't know it. Dofa.", 'speaker A: No, tofu. Translation is.', "speaker B: Oh, you call it this. You don't call it dohua?", 'speaker A: Yeah. In the north we call it.', "speaker B: Oh, cool. I didn't know that. Okay, nice. Cool. This is really nice because actually a lot of places I go, they don't have the savory dohua. Usually people eat the sweet dohua here, but that looks really good. And then it's like protein in the morning.", 'speaker A: Yeah, protein enriched protein.', 'speaker B: But what do people put on top of doha? The tofu. For the breakfast, what is usually goes on top?', 'speaker A: A kind of sauce can make it salty.', 'speaker B: Salty?', "speaker A: Yeah. Otherwise it's like water.", "speaker B: Right. It's kind of like soy sauce. The sauce. Or like chili oil.", 'speaker A: Chili oil, how to spell it?', "speaker B: Yeah. Like chili oil. No, sorry, chili oil. Like this. Ah, the Sauce you talk about is from like meat, Ryan. Totally. Okay. Yeah, it has a lot of flavor. It's very salty. Okay, interesting. You know, a lot of people here, they just go out for breakfast, but actually, I think since food is expensive in the US, we cook a lot of our meals, so we'll make something fast at home. But I noticed most people here, they don't make breakfast. They'll go out and get something fast.", 'speaker A: Yeah. Some of my colleagues would do it by themselves in the morning. So fast. Breakfast.', 'speaker B: Do people eat like, manto?', 'speaker A: Manto is more common at noon. At lunch.', "speaker B: At lunch it's just bread. Okay, that's so funny. Okay. Are a lot of people concerned, like, in the US, we have a lot of different diet trends that people do. Are people in China very concerned with doing diets or. No.", "speaker A: What's the meaning of concerned? Diets pay more than.", "speaker B: No, what I mean is, I don't just mean, like, what they eat. I mean, like making a diet. Like, do people have diet plans in China? Often?", 'speaker A: Not common.', "speaker B: Yeah, it's not common. Okay. Yeah.", "speaker A: Because most people, I think most people don't have basic knowledge about nutrition. Actually, their knowledge about food is from the traditional medicine, I think. But they're not scientific.", "speaker B: Yeah, I know you don't like the chinese medicine. Okay. But I'm mostly wondering, because in the US, we have diet plans that are more like, we have one called Atkins diet, or there's types of diets where people count calories, which is really old. People don't do this so much now, but there's also one recently. This is the one I want to talk to you about. Recently, some Americans have been doing a carnivore diet. Have you heard about this.", 'speaker A: Carnival?', 'speaker B: No. We are all omnivores.', "speaker A: They don't eat the foods from plants. Not at all.", "speaker B: Not at all, bro. It's so weird.", "speaker A: I don't know why. Because if you want to distinguish the food from plants, it's also difficult, isn't it?", 'speaker B: No, because no pasta, no rice, no vegetables. They eat, like, beef and fish and butter. Butter. And they eat nothing else. Maybe eggs. Eggs. Eggs.', 'speaker A: Why do they go like this?', "speaker B: Because I'm telling you, this is a trend. Like a fad, right? People believe, they did a lot of research on diets, on healthy diets, and they believe that a very high protein and fat diet, and no carbs, no sugars, like these types of things. It's like an extreme diet. We would call this an extreme diet, but my aunt and my uncle have been doing this diet for a year, which means they have eaten nothing but meat and eggs and butter for a year.", 'speaker A: How does it affect.', 'speaker B: So, a lot of the time, the reason people do these diets is because they want to have the high muscle mass.', 'speaker A: Right?', "speaker B: High muscle mass and low fat. They don't want to have a lot of fat. So my auntie and my uncle, they lost a lot of weight. Yeah, a lot. They lost a lot of weight. But it's really weird because they kind of ignore the things that are not good that are happening. Like, for example, they cannot poop very well. And they're just like. It's because our body is adjusting or because we don't have a lot of vegetables.", 'speaker A: He cannot poop poop, poop.', 'speaker B: Go to the bathroom. Poop. Poop. Not pee. Poop. Go it.', 'speaker A: Okay, I got.', "speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, Dabian. They cannot poop because their digestive system is not good now anyway. Okay, so I was wondering, China doesn't have any weird diets or something that people try.", 'speaker A: The people in the room pay more attention on it.', 'speaker B: Who?', 'speaker A: Fitness in Jane.', 'speaker B: Fitness. Fitness.', 'speaker A: Fitness. Yeah.', 'speaker B: Like people who train at the. Okay, sure.', 'speaker A: Could this kind of exercise totally were from foreign countries. So all the theory are modern. So they focus on the diet. Actually.', 'speaker B: All of what is modern?', 'speaker A: The workout.', 'speaker B: The workout plan is like a modern workout plan. I never heard anyone say that.', 'speaker A: This kind of sport you work out from abroad.', 'speaker B: Crossfit.', 'speaker A: I search it.', "speaker B: It's like Crossfit. Okay, I think I know what you're talking about. Or maybe not. Or is it bodybuilding?", "speaker A: Yeah. Even the bar. What's the bar? Bell bar and stick bar? Yeah. All of them are abroad.", 'speaker B: You mean imported from abroad?', 'speaker A: Yeah, imported.', "speaker B: Okay, so you're just saying that they do, like, foreign style exercise plans.", 'speaker A: Diet plan and.', 'speaker B: Diet plan.', 'speaker A: Yeah. Okay. This kind of sport was imported. So the people getting involved in are not influenced by the traditional medicine. So they have the same modern diet theory.', "speaker B: Okay, I understand what you're saying. They don't subscribe to the traditional way of thinking. Okay.", 'speaker A: Yeah. And there is also a slogan that 30 percentage exercise and 70% age 18.', 'speaker B: 70% age 1818.', 'speaker A: Right. 70%.', "speaker B: Okay, I see what you're saying. Yeah. Do a lot of people do, like, protein shakes for that? Okay, I know that you work out sometimes. Do you do anything for your diet or do you just eat whatever you want and then exercise?", "speaker A: Coach, make a priority of gona diet about control the calorie, about your calories. Yeah. So I lost weight so fast, but someday he went to his hometown to get married, so there's nobody regulating me. So I went back again.", 'speaker B: Wait, how long has he been gone?', 'speaker A: Three months.', "speaker B: He's not coming back, right?", 'speaker A: Not in Beijing.', 'speaker B: You need a new trainer. We usually call this a trainer, not a coach.', 'speaker A: I found a trainer last night.', 'speaker B: You did? Nice.', 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Okay, cool. At the same gym?', 'speaker A: No, a new gym. A new gym around my.', "speaker B: Nice. So usually we'll say trainer for someone who's helping you go to the gym and train your body. Coach is more for like, for example, if you do like, a b side, if you're doing a competition, then you will have a coach to teach you how to prepare for that.", 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Just a little bit different. Yeah. Okay, so for your workouts, do you mostly do weightlifting or do you also do cardio weightlifting? Okay. Do you do stretching? Do you stretch? Oh, sorry. Go ahead.', 'speaker A: Yeah. After the weight lifting, maybe ten minute stretch is important.', "speaker B: Okay. Wait, you stretch for ten minutes? Oh, that's so good. My boyfriend will never stretch with me. I always tell him, you should stretch, and he skip it. He's like, I'm too lazy because I feel like men usually skip stretching and the women always stretch. You know what I mean? But it's important.", 'speaker A: It night. Patient. Patient. Women are more.', "speaker B: Yeah, when you say, don't say woman, you say women.", 'speaker A: Oh, yeah, women.', "speaker B: Okay. You do weightlifting. So do you usually do. I just want to go through some gym words with you that maybe you don't know. So are you doing endurance lifts like, you try to see how long you can go, or do you do power lifts? Do you know the difference?", 'speaker A: I. Power lift. Emphasize the maximum weight that you can lift.', 'speaker B: Yeah. Power lifts is the maximum weight you can do. And then maybe you just do a few of them, like maybe one, two, three.', 'speaker A: I think I prefer which one? Endurance. Yeah, endurance.', "speaker B: Yeah. I think it's better for you anyway because you're not preparing for, like, a competition or something. Same. Okay. Sorry. The time is running out. Have a good day. Bye."]`

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"Suggestion": {"title": "Suggestion", "description": "\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u6807\u8bb0", "type": "array", "items": {"$ref": "#/definitions/Revision"}}}, "required": ["Suggestion"], "definitions": {"Revision": {"title": "Revision", "type": "object", "properties": {"Round": {"title": "Round", "description": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6570", "type": "string"}, "speaker_A": {"title": "Speaker A", "description": "speaker A \u7684\u539f\u8868\u8fbe", "type": "string"}, "speaker_B": {"title": "Speaker B", "description": "speaker B \u7684\u539f\u8868\u8fbe", "type": "string"}, "authentic_expression": {"title": "Authentic Expression", "description": "\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684authentic expression", "type": "string"}, "tags": {"title": "Tags", "description": "{\n                                            CORRECT\n                                            POLITENESS_USAGE \n                                            SENTENCE_STRUCTURE_ERROR \n                                            WORD_USAGE_ERROR \n                                            SENTENCE_SEQUENCE_ERROR\n                                            TENSE_ERROR\n                                            VOICE_ERROR\n                                            MODAL_VERB_ERROR \n                                            PRONOUN_AGREEMENT_ERROR \n                                            GRAMMAR\n                                            VOCABULARY\n                                            CLARITY_AND_FLUENCY\n                                        }\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u8005\u591a\u4e2a", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["Round", "speaker_A", "speaker_B", "authentic_expression", "tags"]}}}

['speaker A: Hello.', 'speaker B: Hey. Hi, Leo. Can you see me?', 'speaker A: Right. Is this the first time we talking in the morning?', 'speaker B: Me?', 'speaker A: We?', "speaker B: Oh, us. Oh, really? I didn't think about that. Did you just wake up?", 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Why did you decide to start doing lessons in the morning.', 'speaker A: Before every day? We woke up at 10:00 a.m. This year I want to make it early, so I think schedule a lesson is a good way to make me wake up earlier.', 'speaker B: Okay. So usually you wake up at 10:00 a.m. You can have a Coca Cola at 09:00 a.m.?', 'speaker A: Right?', 'speaker B: Is that Coca Cola?', 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: At 09:00 a.m. I never saw that before. I never saw anyone drink soda with breakfast. Shocked. Do you feel like a lot of people drink Coca Cola in, in China? Is it really popular?', 'speaker A: Yeah, my team leader. Really?', "speaker B: Your team leader? Oh, so interesting. Okay. Oh, that's crazy. But what about coffee? You don't want coffee in the morning?", "speaker A: I don't because I have happy to have a nap at noon. Maybe it will influence it.", 'speaker B: So you have a nap and then after your nap you will have coffee.', 'speaker A: Right.', "speaker B: Interesting. Okay, I got it. What about like tea? You don't have any tea to help you wake up. Oh, I cannot see you.", 'speaker A: Hello?', 'speaker B: I cannot see you.', 'speaker A: Can you know.', "speaker B: Let me refresh. What about now? I think it's good. I can see you clearly now. Oh, no, you cannot hear me. Can you hear me? Right, okay, so you said you usually wake up at 10:00 a.m. But I want to know if you start waking up earlier, like at 830 or nine, then will you start going to sleep earlier?", "speaker A: Yeah, that's what I want to have. What time? 02:00 a.m. After. I know what you want to know.", 'speaker B: 02:00 a.m. But now what time will you start going to sleep?', 'speaker A: Midnight.', 'speaker B: Eight or nine.', 'speaker A: Midnight.', 'speaker B: Midnight. Midnight. Okay. When you say midnight, when you say mid, it sounds like you say need. So just try to make a short. I.', 'speaker A: Yeah, I know these things. Mid the night.', 'speaker B: Okay.', 'speaker A: Mid and I.', "speaker B: Okay, I understand. So like 8 hours of sleep or eight and a half hours of sleep. It's good, right? It's good. I feel like a lot of people have the problem for not getting enough sleep. I know a lot of people who only sleep 6 hours a night, but I just feel like I could not function if I did that. Are you the type of person that can get like 6 hours or 5 hours of sleep and still feel good?", 'speaker A: Yeah. All right. I think I am really?', 'speaker B: Okay. But it sounds like you still get more than 8 hours of sleep a night.', 'speaker A: No more than.', 'speaker B: Okay around 8 hours of sleep a night right? Yeah but in the past you had less sleep.', "speaker A: College 02:00 a.m. To 10:00 a.m. 8 hours it's still 8 hours but almost after 02:00 a.m..", "speaker B: Okay but when you stay awake until 02:00 a.m. Is it because you go out or you're at home staying awake until 02:00 a.m. At a home?", 'speaker A: Play the phone.', "speaker B: Just like using your phone? Yeah we don't usually say like play on our phone unless you can say like playing a game on my phone but we would just say like using my phone or sometimes we say something like scrolling. Scrolling means for example if I'm on. Yeah okay. Like social media and I just scroll scroll scroll scroll. This is scrolling and your page is like you could just do this for like an hour and you don't even know. Right? Yeah. Okay I got you. Nice. Okay so we're going to be doing morning lessons now. Good for you. It sounds difficult though. I started doing morning classes at like 08:00 a.m. Which I think for other people 08:00 a.m. Does not sound early but for me that means I have to wake up at 730 so it's really early for me. I don't like waking up so early.", "speaker A: Yeah what's the first thing after you wake up?", 'speaker B: Like what do I do? My morning routine.', 'speaker A: What team? Pardon?', 'speaker B: Morning routine?', "speaker A: Yeah what's her morning routine?", "speaker B: I usually get up and make my bed and then I drink warm water. One sway and then I get dressed and I don't do anything else. I check all my messages because when I'm sleeping it's the daytime in the US so usually when I wake up I have a lot of messages because it's people's daytime so then I will spend the time to respond to everything and then I just start teaching. So I already taught for like 1 hour. Yeah just finished 1 hour. Yeah but I'm not really a morning person like naturally I think maybe also not you.", "speaker A: Yeah when I went to work I just sit here pretend I'm working with further lunch.", "speaker B: Okay so afternoon you're more productive.", 'speaker A: All right.', "speaker B: But I am definitely the type of person who likes to eat breakfast. Many times I can skip lunch or skip dinner but I don't like to skip breakfast because I feel much better if I eat breakfast.", 'speaker A: Okay I never eat breakfast.', 'speaker B: Oh you never eat breakfast? Just Coca Cola?', "speaker A: No, it's not the routine.", 'speaker B: Okay.', 'speaker A: I just want to drink something. So I find a coca Cola in the refrigerator.', "speaker B: Sorry, it's just crazy to me. I could never drink that. Okay, so you never eat breakfast, right. Really? My sister is like that too, because.", "speaker A: In the college I got up later even more, maybe 11:00 so it's not sort of time to eat breakfast.", 'speaker B: But would you still eat when you woke up?', 'speaker A: I just eat lunch.', "speaker B: Yeah, but that's still like 1 hour after you wake up, so it's technically like your morning.", "speaker A: Yeah, but I maybe wash something. Okay. When I went to dining hall, it's.", "speaker B: I'm curious. I kind of know what the common breakfast is to have in Taiwan. But what are the common breakfast for people in, like, what do people usually.", 'speaker A: Have for breakfast in Beijing? In all the area of north China? The bald.', 'speaker B: Yotiao.', 'speaker A: Bald. And milk. Do you know dofano?', 'speaker B: Dofino.', "speaker A: Made of beans, but it's like dozen.", "speaker B: Okay. I don't know it. Dofa.", 'speaker A: No, tofu. Translation is.', "speaker B: Oh, you call it this. You don't call it dohua?", 'speaker A: Yeah. In the north we call it.', "speaker B: Oh, cool. I didn't know that. Okay, nice. Cool. This is really nice because actually a lot of places I go, they don't have the savory dohua. Usually people eat the sweet dohua here, but that looks really good. And then it's like protein in the morning.", 'speaker A: Yeah, protein enriched protein.', 'speaker B: But what do people put on top of doha? The tofu. For the breakfast, what is usually goes on top?', 'speaker A: A kind of sauce can make it salty.', 'speaker B: Salty?', "speaker A: Yeah. Otherwise it's like water.", "speaker B: Right. It's kind of like soy sauce. The sauce. Or like chili oil.", 'speaker A: Chili oil, how to spell it?', "speaker B: Yeah. Like chili oil. No, sorry, chili oil. Like this. Ah, the Sauce you talk about is from like meat, Ryan. Totally. Okay. Yeah, it has a lot of flavor. It's very salty. Okay, interesting. You know, a lot of people here, they just go out for breakfast, but actually, I think since food is expensive in the US, we cook a lot of our meals, so we'll make something fast at home. But I noticed most people here, they don't make breakfast. They'll go out and get something fast.", 'speaker A: Yeah. Some of my colleagues would do it by themselves in the morning. So fast. Breakfast.', 'speaker B: Do people eat like, manto?', 'speaker A: Manto is more common at noon. At lunch.', "speaker B: At lunch it's just bread. Okay, that's so funny. Okay. Are a lot of people concerned, like, in the US, we have a lot of different diet trends that people do. Are people in China very concerned with doing diets or. No.", "speaker A: What's the meaning of concerned? Diets pay more than.", "speaker B: No, what I mean is, I don't just mean, like, what they eat. I mean, like making a diet. Like, do people have diet plans in China? Often?", 'speaker A: Not common.', "speaker B: Yeah, it's not common. Okay. Yeah.", "speaker A: Because most people, I think most people don't have basic knowledge about nutrition. Actually, their knowledge about food is from the traditional medicine, I think. But they're not scientific.", "speaker B: Yeah, I know you don't like the chinese medicine. Okay. But I'm mostly wondering, because in the US, we have diet plans that are more like, we have one called Atkins diet, or there's types of diets where people count calories, which is really old. People don't do this so much now, but there's also one recently. This is the one I want to talk to you about. Recently, some Americans have been doing a carnivore diet. Have you heard about this.", 'speaker A: Carnival?', 'speaker B: No. We are all omnivores.', "speaker A: They don't eat the foods from plants. Not at all.", "speaker B: Not at all, bro. It's so weird.", "speaker A: I don't know why. Because if you want to distinguish the food from plants, it's also difficult, isn't it?", 'speaker B: No, because no pasta, no rice, no vegetables. They eat, like, beef and fish and butter. Butter. And they eat nothing else. Maybe eggs. Eggs. Eggs.', 'speaker A: Why do they go like this?', "speaker B: Because I'm telling you, this is a trend. Like a fad, right? People believe, they did a lot of research on diets, on healthy diets, and they believe that a very high protein and fat diet, and no carbs, no sugars, like these types of things. It's like an extreme diet. We would call this an extreme diet, but my aunt and my uncle have been doing this diet for a year, which means they have eaten nothing but meat and eggs and butter for a year.", 'speaker A: How does it affect.', 'speaker B: So, a lot of the time, the reason people do these diets is because they want to have the high muscle mass.', 'speaker A: Right?', "speaker B: High muscle mass and low fat. They don't want to have a lot of fat. So my auntie and my uncle, they lost a lot of weight. Yeah, a lot. They lost a lot of weight. But it's really weird because they kind of ignore the things that are not good that are happening. Like, for example, they cannot poop very well. And they're just like. It's because our body is adjusting or because we don't have a lot of vegetables.", 'speaker A: He cannot poop poop, poop.', 'speaker B: Go to the bathroom. Poop. Poop. Not pee. Poop. Go it.', 'speaker A: Okay, I got.', "speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, Dabian. They cannot poop because their digestive system is not good now anyway. Okay, so I was wondering, China doesn't have any weird diets or something that people try.", 'speaker A: The people in the room pay more attention on it.', 'speaker B: Who?', 'speaker A: Fitness in Jane.', 'speaker B: Fitness. Fitness.', 'speaker A: Fitness. Yeah.', 'speaker B: Like people who train at the. Okay, sure.', 'speaker A: Could this kind of exercise totally were from foreign countries. So all the theory are modern. So they focus on the diet. Actually.', 'speaker B: All of what is modern?', 'speaker A: The workout.', 'speaker B: The workout plan is like a modern workout plan. I never heard anyone say that.', 'speaker A: This kind of sport you work out from abroad.', 'speaker B: Crossfit.', 'speaker A: I search it.', "speaker B: It's like crossfit. Okay, I think I know what you're talking about. Or maybe not. Or is it bodybuilding?", "speaker A: Yeah. Even the bar. What's the bar? Bell bar and stick bar? Yeah. All of them are abroad.", 'speaker B: You mean imported from abroad?', 'speaker A: Yeah, imported.', "speaker B: Okay, so you're just saying that they do, like, foreign style exercise plans.", 'speaker A: Diet plan and.', 'speaker B: Diet plan.', 'speaker A: Yeah. Okay. This kind of sport was imported. So the people getting involved in are not influenced by the traditional medicine. So they have the same modern diet theory.', "speaker B: Okay, I understand what you're saying. They don't subscribe to the traditional way of thinking. Okay.", 'speaker A: Yeah. And there is also a slogan that 30 percentage exercise and 70% age 18.', 'speaker B: 70% age 1818.', 'speaker A: Right. 70%.', "speaker B: Okay, I see what you're saying. Yeah. Do a lot of people do, like, protein shakes for that? Okay, I know that you work out sometimes. Do you do anything for your diet or do you just eat whatever you want and then exercise?", "speaker A: Coach, make a priority of gona diet about control the calorie, about your calories. Yeah. So I lost weight so fast, but someday he went to his hometown to get married, so there's nobody regulating me. So I went back again.", 'speaker B: Wait, how long has he been gone?', 'speaker A: Three months.', "speaker B: He's not coming back, right?", 'speaker A: Not in Beijing.', 'speaker B: You need a new trainer. We usually call this a trainer, not a coach.', 'speaker A: I found a trainer last night.', 'speaker B: You did? Nice.', 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Okay, cool. At the same gym?', 'speaker A: No, a new gym. A new gym around my.', "speaker B: Nice. So usually we'll say trainer for someone who's helping you go to the gym and train your body. Coach is more for like, for example, if you do like, a b side, if you're doing a competition, then you will have a coach to teach you how to prepare for that.", 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Just a little bit different. Yeah. Okay, so for your workouts, do you mostly do weightlifting or do you also do cardio weightlifting? Okay. Do you do stretching? Do you stretch? Oh, sorry. Go ahead.', 'speaker A: Yeah. After the weight lifting, maybe ten minute stretch is important.', "speaker B: Okay. Wait, you stretch for 10 minutes? Oh, that's so good. My boyfriend will never stretch with me. I always tell him, you should stretch, and he skip it. He's like, I'm too lazy because I feel like men usually skip stretching and the women always stretch. You know what I mean? But it's important.", 'speaker A: It night. Patient. Patient. Women are more.', "speaker B: Yeah, when you say, don't say woman, you say women.", 'speaker A: Oh, yeah, women.', "speaker B: Okay. You do weightlifting. So do you usually do. I just want to go through some gym words with you that maybe you don't know.

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"Suggestion": {"title": "Suggestion", "description": "\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u6807\u8bb0", "type": "array", "items": {"$ref": "#/definitions/Revision"}}}, "required": ["Suggestion"], "definitions": {"Revision": {"title": "Revision", "type": "object", "properties": {"Round": {"title": "Round", "description": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6570", "type": "string"}, "speaker_A": {"title": "Speaker A", "description": "speaker A \u7684\u539f\u8868\u8fbe", "type": "string"}, "speaker_B": {"title": "Speaker B", "description": "speaker B \u7684\u539f\u8868\u8fbe", "type": "string"}, "authentic_expression": {"title": "Authentic Expression", "description": "\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684authentic expression", "type": "string"}, "tags": {"title": "Tags", "description": "{\n                                            CORRECT\n                                            POLITENESS_USAGE \n                                            SENTENCE_STRUCTURE_ERROR \n                                            WORD_USAGE_ERROR \n                                            SENTENCE_SEQUENCE_ERROR\n                                            TENSE_ERROR\n                                            VOICE_ERROR\n                                            MODAL_VERB_ERROR \n                                            PRONOUN_AGREEMENT_ERROR \n                                            GRAMMAR\n                                            VOCABULARY\n                                            CLARITY_AND_FLUENCY\n                                        }\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u8005\u591a\u4e2a", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["Round", "speaker_A", "speaker_B", "authentic_expression", "tags"]}}}

Oh, really? I didn't think about that. Did you just wake up?", 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Why did you decide to start doing lessons in the morning.', 'speaker A: Before every day? We woke up at 10:00 a.m. This year I want to make it early, so I think schedule a lesson is a good way to make me wake up earlier.', 'speaker B: Okay. So usually you wake up at 10:00 a.m. You can have a Coca Cola at 09:00 a.m.?', 'speaker A: Right?', 'speaker B: Is that Coca Cola?', 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: At 09:00 a.m. I never saw that before. I never saw anyone drink soda with breakfast. Shocked. Do you feel like a lot of people drink Coca Cola in, in China? Is it really popular?', 'speaker A: Yeah, my team leader. Really?', "speaker B: Your team leader? Oh, so interesting. Okay. Oh, that's crazy. But what about coffee? You don't want coffee in the morning?", "speaker A: I don't because I have happy to have a nap at noon. Maybe it will influence it.", 'speaker B: So you have a nap and then after your nap you will have coffee.', 'speaker A: Right.', "speaker B: Interesting. Okay, I got it. What about like tea? You don't have any tea to help you wake up. Oh, I cannot see you.", 'speaker A: Hello?', 'speaker B: I cannot see you.', 'speaker A: Can you know.', "speaker B: Let me refresh. What about now? I think it's good. I can see you clearly now. Oh, no, you cannot hear me. Can you hear me? Right, okay, so you said you usually wake up at 10:00 a.m. But I want to know if you start waking up earlier, like at 830 or nine, then will you start going to sleep earlier?", "speaker A: Yeah, that's what I want to have. What time? 02:00 a.m. After. I know what you want to know.", 'speaker B: 02:00 a.m. But now what time will you start going to sleep?', 'speaker A: Midnight.', 'speaker B: Eight or nine.', 'speaker A: Midnight.', 'speaker B: Midnight. Midnight. Okay. When you say midnight, when you say mid, it sounds like you say need. So just try to make a short. I.', 'speaker A: Yeah, I know these things. Mid the night.', 'speaker B: Okay.', 'speaker A: Mid and I.', "speaker B: Okay, I understand. So like 8 hours of sleep or eight and a half hours of sleep. It's good, right? It's good. I feel like a lot of people have the problem for not getting enough sleep. I know a lot of people who only sleep 6 hours a night, but I just feel like I could not function if I did that. Are you the type of person that can get like 6 hours or 5 hours of sleep and still feel good?", 'speaker A: Yeah. All right. I think I am really?', 'speaker B: Okay. But it sounds like you still get more than 8 hours of sleep a night.', 'speaker A: No more than.', 'speaker B: Okay around 8 hours of sleep a night right? Yeah but in the past you had less sleep.', "speaker A: College 02:00 a.m. To 10:00 a.m. 8 hours it's still 8 hours but almost after 02:00 a.m..", "speaker B: Okay but when you stay awake until 02:00 a.m. Is it because you go out or you're at home staying awake until 02:00 a.m. At a home?", 'speaker A: Play the phone.', "speaker B: Just like using your phone? Yeah we don't usually say like play on our phone unless you can say like playing a game on my phone but we would just say like using my phone or sometimes we say something like scrolling. Scrolling means for example if I'm on. Yeah okay. Like social media and I just scroll scroll scroll scroll. This is scrolling and your page is like you could just do this for like an hour and you don't even know. Right? Yeah. Okay I got you. Nice. Okay so we're going to be doing morning lessons now. Good for you. It sounds difficult though. I started doing morning classes at like 08:00 a.m. Which I think for other people 08:00 a.m. Does not sound early but for me that means I have to wake up at 730 so it's really early for me. I don't like waking up so early.", "speaker A: Yeah what's the first thing after you wake up?", 'speaker B: Like what do I do? My morning routine.', 'speaker A: What team? Pardon?', 'speaker B: Morning routine?', "speaker A: Yeah what's her morning routine?", "speaker B: I usually get up and make my bed and then I drink warm water. One sway and then I get dressed and I don't do anything else. I check all my messages because when I'm sleeping it's the daytime in the US so usually when I wake up I have a lot of messages because it's people's daytime so then I will spend the time to respond to everything and then I just start teaching. So I already taught for like 1 hour. Yeah just finished 1 hour. Yeah but I'm not really a morning person like naturally I think maybe also not you.", "speaker A: Yeah when I went to work I just sit here pretend I'm working with further lunch.", "speaker B: Okay so afternoon you're more productive.", 'speaker A: All right.', "speaker B: But I am definitely the type of person who likes to eat breakfast. Many times I can skip lunch or skip dinner but I don't like to skip breakfast because I feel much better if I eat breakfast.", 'speaker A: Okay I never eat breakfast.', 'speaker B: Oh you never eat breakfast? Just Coca Cola?', "speaker A: No, it's not the routine.", 'speaker B: Okay.', 'speaker A: I just want to drink something. So I find a coca Cola in the refrigerator.', "speaker B: Sorry, it's just crazy to me. I could never drink that. Okay, so you never eat breakfast, right. Really? My sister is like that too, because.", "speaker A: In the college I got up later even more, maybe 11:00 so it's not sort of time to eat breakfast.", 'speaker B: But would you still eat when you woke up?', 'speaker A: I just eat lunch.', "speaker B: Yeah, but that's still like 1 hour after you wake up, so it's technically like your morning.", "speaker A: Yeah, but I maybe wash something. Okay. When I went to dining hall, it's.", "speaker B: I'm curious. I kind of know what the common breakfast is to have in Taiwan. But what are the common breakfast for people in, like, what do people usually.", 'speaker A: Have for breakfast in Beijing? In all the area of north China? The bald.', 'speaker B: Yotiao.', 'speaker A: Bald. And milk. Do you know dofano?', 'speaker B: Dofino.', "speaker A: Made of beans, but it's like dozen.", "speaker B: Okay. I don't know it. Dofa.", 'speaker A: No, tofu. Translation is.', "speaker B: Oh, you call it this. You don't call it dohua?", 'speaker A: Yeah. In the north we call it.', "speaker B: Oh, cool. I didn't know that. Okay, nice. Cool. This is really nice because actually a lot of places I go, they don't have the savory dohua. Usually people eat the sweet dohua here, but that looks really good. And then it's like protein in the morning.", 'speaker A: Yeah, protein enriched protein.', 'speaker B: But what do people put on top of doha? The tofu. For the breakfast, what is usually goes on top?', 'speaker A: A kind of sauce can make it salty.', 'speaker B: Salty?', "speaker A: Yeah. Otherwise it's like water.", "speaker B: Right. It's kind of like soy sauce. The sauce. Or like chili oil.", 'speaker A: Chili oil, how to spell it?', "speaker B: Yeah. Like chili oil. No, sorry, chili oil. Like this. Ah, the Sauce you talk about is from like meat, Ryan. Totally. Okay. Yeah, it has a lot of flavor. It's very salty. Okay, interesting. You know, a lot of people here, they just go out for breakfast, but actually, I think since food is expensive in the US, we cook a lot of our meals, so we'll make something fast at home. But I noticed most people here, they don't make breakfast. They'll go out and get something fast.", 'speaker A: Yeah. Some of my colleagues would do it by themselves in the morning. So fast. Breakfast.', 'speaker B: Do people eat like, manto?', 'speaker A: Manto is more common at noon. At lunch.', "speaker B: At lunch it's just bread. Okay, that's so funny. Okay. Are a lot of people concerned, like, in the US, we have a lot of different diet trends that people do. Are people in China very concerned with doing diets or. No.", "speaker A: What's the meaning of concerned? Diets pay more than.", "speaker B: No, what I mean is, I don't just mean, like, what they eat. I mean, like making a diet. Like, do people have diet plans in China? Often?", 'speaker A: Not common.', "speaker B: Yeah, it's not common. Okay. Yeah.", "speaker A: Because most people, I think most people don't have basic knowledge about nutrition. Actually, their knowledge about food is from the traditional medicine, I think. But they're not scientific.", "speaker B: Yeah, I know you don't like the chinese medicine. Okay. But I'm mostly wondering, because in the US, we have diet plans that are more like, we have one called Atkins diet, or there's types of diets where people count calories, which is really old. People don't do this so much now, but there's also one recently. This is the one I want to talk to you about. Recently, some Americans have been doing a carnivore diet. Have you heard about this.", 'speaker A: Carnival?', 'speaker B: No. We are all omnivores.', "speaker A: They don't eat the foods from plants. Not at all.", "speaker B: Not at all, bro. It's so weird.", "speaker A: I don't know why. Because if you want to distinguish the food from plants, it's also difficult, isn't it?", 'speaker B: No, because no pasta, no rice, no vegetables. They eat, like, beef and fish and butter. Butter. And they eat nothing else. Maybe eggs. Eggs. Eggs.', 'speaker A: Why do they go like this?', "speaker B: Because I'm telling you, this is a trend. Like a fad, right? People believe, they did a lot of research on diets, on healthy diets, and they believe that a very high protein and fat diet, and no carbs, no sugars, like these types of things. It's like an extreme diet. We would call this an extreme diet, but my aunt and my uncle have been doing this diet for a year, which means they have eaten nothing but meat and eggs and butter for a year.", 'speaker A: How does it affect.', 'speaker B: So, a lot of the time, the reason people do these diets is because they want to have the high muscle mass.', 'speaker A: Right?', "speaker B: High muscle mass and low fat. They don't want to have a lot of fat. So my auntie and my uncle, they lost a lot of weight. Yeah, a lot. They lost a lot of weight. But it's really weird because they kind of ignore the things that are not good that are happening. Like, for example, they cannot poop very well. And they're just like. It's because our body is adjusting or because we don't have a lot of vegetables.", 'speaker A: He cannot poop poop, poop.', 'speaker B: Go to the bathroom. Poop. Poop. Not pee. Poop. Go it.', 'speaker A: Okay, I got.', "speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, Dabian. They cannot poop because their digestive system is not good now anyway. Okay, so I was wondering, China doesn't have any weird diets or something that people try.", 'speaker A: The people in the room pay more attention on it.', 'speaker B: Who?', 'speaker A: Fitness in Jane.', 'speaker B: Fitness. Fitness.', 'speaker A: Fitness. Yeah.', 'speaker B: Like people who train at the. Okay, sure.', 'speaker A: Could this kind of exercise totally were from foreign countries. So all the theory are modern. So they focus on the diet. Actually.', 'speaker B: All of what is modern?', 'speaker A: The workout.', 'speaker B: The workout plan is like a modern workout plan. I never heard anyone say that.', 'speaker A: This kind of sport you work out from abroad.', 'speaker B: Crossfit.', 'speaker A: I search it.', "speaker B: It's like Crossfit. Okay, I think I know what you're talking about. Or maybe not. Or is it bodybuilding?", "speaker A: Yeah. Even the bar. What's the bar? Bell bar and stick bar? Yeah. All of them are abroad.", 'speaker B: You mean imported from abroad?', 'speaker A: Yeah, imported.', "speaker B: Okay, so you're just saying that they do, like, foreign style exercise plans.", 'speaker A: Diet plan and.', 'speaker B: Diet plan.', 'speaker A: Yeah. Okay. This kind of sport was imported. So the people getting involved in are not influenced by the traditional medicine. So they have the same modern diet theory.', "speaker B: Okay, I understand what you're saying. They don't subscribe to the traditional way of thinking. Okay.", 'speaker A: Yeah. And there is also a slogan that 30 percentage exercise and 70% age 18.', 'speaker B: 70% age 1818.', 'speaker A: Right. 70%.', "speaker B: Okay, I see what you're saying. Yeah. Do a lot of people do, like, protein shakes for that? Okay, I know that you work out sometimes. Do you do anything for your diet or do you just eat whatever you want and then exercise?", "speaker A: Coach, make a priority of gona diet about control the calorie, about your calories. Yeah.

                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"Suggestion": {"title": "Suggestion", "description": "\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u6807\u8bb0", "type": "array", "items": {"$ref": "#/definitions/Revision"}}}, "required": ["Suggestion"], "definitions": {"Revision": {"title": "Revision", "type": "object", "properties": {"Round": {"title": "Round", "description": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6570", "type": "string"}, "speaker_A": {"title": "Speaker A", "description": "speaker A \u7684\u539f\u8868\u8fbe", "type": "string"}, "speaker_B": {"title": "Speaker B", "description": "speaker B \u7684\u539f\u8868\u8fbe", "type": "string"}, "authentic_expression": {"title": "Authentic Expression", "description": "\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684authentic expression", "type": "string"}, "tags": {"title": "Tags", "description": "{\n                                            CORRECT\n                                            POLITENESS_USAGE \n                                            SENTENCE_STRUCTURE_ERROR \n                                            WORD_USAGE_ERROR \n                                            SENTENCE_SEQUENCE_ERROR\n                                            TENSE_ERROR\n                                            VOICE_ERROR\n                                            MODAL_VERB_ERROR \n                                            PRONOUN_AGREEMENT_ERROR \n                                            GRAMMAR\n                                            VOCABULARY\n                                            CLARITY_AND_FLUENCY\n                                        }\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u8005\u591a\u4e2a", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["Round", "speaker_A", "speaker_B", "authentic_expression", "tags"]}}}

['speaker A: Hello.', 'speaker B: Hey. Hi, Leo. Can you see me?', 'speaker A: Right. Is this the first time we talking in the morning?', 'speaker B: Me?', 'speaker A: We?', "speaker B: Oh, us. Oh, really? I didn't think about that. Did you just wake up?", 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Why did you decide to start doing lessons in the morning.', 'speaker A: Before every day? We woke up at 10:00 a.m. This year I want to make it early, so I think schedule a lesson is a good way to make me wake up earlier.', 'speaker B: Okay. So usually you wake up at 10:00 a.m. You can have a Coca Cola at 09:00 a.m.?', 'speaker A: Right?', 'speaker B: Is that Coca Cola?', 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: At 09:00 a.m. I never saw that before. I never saw anyone drink soda with breakfast. Shocked. Do you feel like a lot of people drink Coca Cola in, in China? Is it really popular?', 'speaker A: Yeah, my team leader. Really?', "speaker B: Your team leader? Oh, so interesting. Okay. Oh, that's crazy. But what about coffee? You don't want coffee in the morning?", "speaker A: I don't because I have happy to have a nap at noon. Maybe it will influence it.", 'speaker B: So you have a nap and then after your nap you will have coffee.', 'speaker A: Right.', "speaker B: Interesting. Okay, I got it. What about like tea? You don't have any tea to help you wake up. Oh, I cannot see you.", 'speaker A: Hello?', 'speaker B: I cannot see you.', 'speaker A: Can you know.', "speaker B: Let me refresh. What about now? I think it's good. I can see you clearly now. Oh, no, you cannot hear me. Can you hear me? Right, okay, so you said you usually wake up at 10:00 a.m. But I want to know if you start waking up earlier, like at 830 or nine, then will you start going to sleep earlier?", "speaker A: Yeah, that's what I want to have. What time? 02:00 a.m. After. I know what you want to know.", 'speaker B: 02:00 a.m. But now what time will you start going to sleep?', 'speaker A: Midnight.', 'speaker B: Eight or nine.', 'speaker A: Midnight.', 'speaker B: Midnight. Midnight. Okay. When you say midnight, when you say mid, it sounds like you say need. So just try to make a short. I.', 'speaker A: Yeah, I know these things. Mid the night.', 'speaker B: Okay.', 'speaker A: Mid and I.', "speaker B: Okay, I understand. So like 8 hours of sleep or eight and a half hours of sleep. It's good, right? It's good. I feel like a lot of people have the problem for not getting enough sleep. I know a lot of people who only sleep 6 hours a night, but I just feel like I could not function if I did that. Are you the type of person that can get like 6 hours or 5 hours of sleep and still feel good?", 'speaker A: Yeah. All right. I think I am really?', 'speaker B: Okay. But it sounds like you still get more than 8 hours of sleep a night.', 'speaker A: No more than.', 'speaker B: Okay around 8 hours of sleep a night right? Yeah but in the past you had less sleep.', "speaker A: College 02:00 a.m. To 10:00 a.m. 8 hours it's still 8 hours but almost after 02:00 a.m..", "speaker B: Okay but when you stay awake until 02:00 a.m. Is it because you go out or you're at home staying awake until 02:00 a.m. At a home?", 'speaker A: Play the phone.', "speaker B: Just like using your phone? Yeah we don't usually say like play on our phone unless you can say like playing a game on my phone but we would just say like using my phone or sometimes we say something like scrolling. Scrolling means for example if I'm on. Yeah okay. Like social media and I just scroll scroll scroll scroll. This is scrolling and your page is like you could just do this for like an hour and you don't even know. Right? Yeah. Okay I got you. Nice. Okay so we're going to be doing morning lessons now. Good for you. It sounds difficult though. I started doing morning classes at like 08:00 a.m. Which I think for other people 08:00 a.m. Does not sound early but for me that means I have to wake up at 730 so it's really early for me. I don't like waking up so early.", "speaker A: Yeah what's the first thing after you wake up?", 'speaker B: Like what do I do? My morning routine.', 'speaker A: What team? Pardon?', 'speaker B: Morning routine?', "speaker A: Yeah what's her morning routine?", "speaker B: I usually get up and make my bed and then I drink warm water. One sway and then I get dressed and I don't do anything else. I check all my messages because when I'm sleeping it's the daytime in the US so usually when I wake up I have a lot of messages because it's people's daytime so then I will spend the time to respond to everything and then I just start teaching. So I already taught for like 1 hour. Yeah just finished 1 hour. Yeah but I'm not really a morning person like naturally I think maybe also not you.", "speaker A: Yeah when I went to work I just sit here pretend I'm working with further lunch.", "speaker B: Okay so afternoon you're more productive.", 'speaker A: All right.', "speaker B: But I am definitely the type of person who likes to eat breakfast. Many times I can skip lunch or skip dinner but I don't like to skip breakfast because I feel much better if I eat breakfast.", 'speaker A: Okay I never eat breakfast.', 'speaker B: Oh you never eat breakfast? Just Coca Cola?', "speaker A: No, it's not the routine.", 'speaker B: Okay.', 'speaker A: I just want to drink something. So I find a coca Cola in the refrigerator.', "speaker B: Sorry, it's just crazy to me. I could never drink that. Okay, so you never eat breakfast, right. Really? My sister is like that too, because.", "speaker A: In the college I got up later even more, maybe 11:00 so it's not sort of time to eat breakfast.", 'speaker B: But would you still eat when you woke up?', 'speaker A: I just eat lunch.', "speaker B: Yeah, but that's still like 1 hour after you wake up, so it's technically like your morning.", "speaker A: Yeah, but I maybe wash something. Okay. When I went to dining hall, it's.", "speaker B: I'm curious. I kind of know what the common breakfast is to have in Taiwan. But what are the common breakfast for people in, like, what do people usually.", 'speaker A: Have for breakfast in Beijing? In all the area of north China? The bald.', 'speaker B: Yotiao.', 'speaker A: Bald. And milk. Do you know dofano?', 'speaker B: Dofino.', "speaker A: Made of beans, but it's like dozen.", "speaker B: Okay. I don't know it. Dofa.", 'speaker A: No, tofu. Translation is.', "speaker B: Oh, you call it this. You don't call it dohua?", 'speaker A: Yeah. In the north we call it.', "speaker B: Oh, cool. I didn't know that. Okay, nice. Cool. This is really nice because actually a lot of places I go, they don't have the savory dohua. Usually people eat the sweet dohua here, but that looks really good. And then it's like protein in the morning.", 'speaker A: Yeah, protein enriched protein.', 'speaker B: But what do people put on top of doha? The tofu. For the breakfast, what is usually goes on top?', 'speaker A: A kind of sauce can make it salty.', 'speaker B: Salty?', "speaker A: Yeah. Otherwise it's like water.", "speaker B: Right. It's kind of like soy sauce. The sauce. Or like chili oil.", 'speaker A: Chili oil, how to spell it?', "speaker B: Yeah. Like chili oil. No, sorry, chili oil. Like this. Ah, the Sauce you talk about is from like meat, Ryan. Totally. Okay. Yeah, it has a lot of flavor. It's very salty. Okay, interesting. You know, a lot of people here, they just go out for breakfast, but actually, I think since food is expensive in the US, we cook a lot of our meals, so we'll make something fast at home. But I noticed most people here, they don't make breakfast. They'll go out and get something fast.", 'speaker A: Yeah. Some of my colleagues would do it by themselves in the morning. So fast. Breakfast.', 'speaker B: Do people eat like, manto?', 'speaker A: Manto is more common at noon. At lunch.', "speaker B: At lunch it's just bread. Okay, that's so funny. Okay. Are a lot of people concerned, like, in the US, we have a lot of different diet trends that people do. Are people in China very concerned with doing diets or. No.", "speaker A: What's the meaning of concerned? Diets pay more than.", "speaker B: No, what I mean is, I don't just mean, like, what they eat. I mean, like making a diet. Like, do people have diet plans in China? Often?", 'speaker A: Not common.', "speaker B: Yeah, it's not common. Okay. Yeah.", "speaker A: Because most people, I think most people don't have basic knowledge about nutrition. Actually, their knowledge about food is from the traditional medicine, I think. But they're not scientific.", "speaker B: Yeah, I know you don't like the chinese medicine. Okay. But I'm mostly wondering, because in the US, we have diet plans that are more like, we have one called Atkins diet, or there's types of diets where people count calories, which is really old. People don't do this so much now, but there's also one recently. This is the one I want to talk to you about. Recently, some Americans have been doing a carnivore diet. Have you heard about this.", 'speaker A: Carnival?', 'speaker B: No. We are all omnivores.', "speaker A: They don't eat the foods from plants. Not at all.", "speaker B: Not at all, bro. It's so weird.", "speaker A: I don't know why. Because if you want to distinguish the food from plants, it's also difficult, isn't it?", 'speaker B: No, because no pasta, no rice, no vegetables. They eat, like, beef and fish and butter. Butter. And they eat nothing else. Maybe eggs. Eggs. Eggs.', 'speaker A: Why do they go like this?', "speaker B: Because I'm telling you, this is a trend. Like a fad, right? People believe, they did a lot of research on diets, on healthy diets, and they believe that a very high protein and fat diet, and no carbs, no sugars, like these types of things. It's like an extreme diet. We would call this an extreme diet, but my aunt and my uncle have been doing this diet for a year, which means they have eaten nothing but meat and eggs and butter for a year.", 'speaker A: How does it affect.', 'speaker B: So, a lot of the time, the reason people do these diets is because they want to have the high muscle mass.', 'speaker A: Right?', "speaker B: High muscle mass and low fat. They don't want to have a lot of fat. So my auntie and my uncle, they lost a lot of weight. Yeah, a lot. They lost a lot of weight. But it's really weird because they kind of ignore the things that are not good that are happening. Like, for example, they cannot poop very well. And they're just like. It's because our body is adjusting or because we don't have a lot of vegetables.", 'speaker A: He cannot poop poop, poop.', 'speaker B: Go to the bathroom. Poop. Poop. Not pee. Poop. Go it.', 'speaker A: Okay, I got.', "speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, Dabian. They cannot poop because their digestive system is not good now anyway. Okay, so I was wondering, China doesn't have any weird diets or something that people try.", 'speaker A: The people in the room pay more attention on it.', 'speaker B: Who?', 'speaker A: Fitness in Jane.', 'speaker B: Fitness. Fitness.', 'speaker A: Fitness. Yeah.', 'speaker B: Like people who train at the. Okay, sure.', 'speaker A: Could this kind of exercise totally were from foreign countries. So all the theory are modern. So they focus on the diet. Actually.', 'speaker B: All of what is modern?', 'speaker A: The workout.', 'speaker B: The workout plan is like a modern workout plan. I never heard anyone say that.', 'speaker A: This kind of sport you work out from abroad.', 'speaker B: Crossfit.', 'speaker A: I search it.', "speaker B: It's like Crossfit. Okay, I think I know what you're talking about. Or maybe not. Or is it bodybuilding?", "speaker A: Yeah. Even the bar. What's the bar? Bell bar and stick bar? Yeah. All of them are abroad.", 'speaker B: You mean imported from abroad?', 'speaker A: Yeah, imported.', "speaker B: Okay, so you're just saying that they do, like, foreign style exercise plans.", 'speaker A: Diet plan and.', 'speaker B: Diet plan.', 'speaker A: Yeah. Okay. This kind of sport was imported. So the people getting involved in are not influenced by the traditional medicine. So they have the same modern diet theory.', "speaker B: Okay, I understand what you're saying. They don't subscribe to the traditional way of thinking. Okay.", 'speaker A: Yeah. And there is also a slogan that 30 percentage exercise and 70% age 18.', 'speaker B: 70% age 1818.', 'speaker A: Right. 70%.', "speaker B: Okay, I see what you're saying. Yeah. Do a lot of people do, like, protein shakes for that? Okay, I know that you work out sometimes. Do you do anything for your diet or do you just eat whatever you want and then exercise?", "speaker A: Coach, make a priority of gona diet about control the calorie, about your calories. Yeah. So I lost weight so fast, but someday he went to his hometown to get married, so there's nobody regulating me. So I went back again.", 'speaker B: Wait, how long has he been gone?', 'speaker A: Three months.', "speaker B: He's not coming back, right?", 'speaker A: Not in Beijing.', 'speaker B: You need a new trainer. We usually call this a trainer, not a coach.', 'speaker A: I found a trainer last night.', 'speaker B: You did? Nice.', 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Okay, cool. At the same gym?', 'speaker A: No, a new gym. A new gym around my.', "speaker B: Nice. So usually we'll say trainer for someone who's helping you go to the gym and train your body. Coach is more for like, for example, if you do like, a b side, if you're doing a competition, then you will have a coach to teach you how to prepare for that.", 'speaker A: Yeah.', 'speaker B: Just a little bit different. Yeah. Okay, so for your workouts, do you mostly do weightlifting or do you also do cardio weightlifting? Okay. Do you do stretching? Do you stretch? Oh, sorry. Go ahead.', 'speaker A: Yeah. After the weight lifting, maybe ten minute stretch is important.', "speaker B: Okay. Wait, you stretch for ten minutes? Oh, that's so good. My boyfriend will never stretch with me. I always tell him, you should stretch, and he skip it. He's like, I'm too lazy because I feel like men usually skip stretching and the women always stretch. You know what I mean? But it's important.", 'speaker A: It night. Patient. Patient. Women are more.', "speaker B: Yeah, when you say, don't say woman, you say women.", 'speaker A: Oh, yeah, women.', "speaker B: Okay. You do weightlifting. So do you usually do. I just want to go through some gym words with you that maybe you don't know. So are you doing endurance lifts like, you try to see how long you can go, or do you do power lifts? Do you know the difference?", 'speaker A: I. Power lift. Emphasize the maximum weight that you can lift.', 'speaker B: Yeah. Power lifts is the maximum weight you can do. And then maybe you just do a few of them, like maybe one, two, three.', 'speaker A: I think I prefer which one? Endurance. Yeah, endurance.', "speaker B: Yeah. I think it's better for you anyway because you're not preparing for, like, a competition or something. Same. Okay. Sorry. The time is running out. Have a good day. Bye."]`

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

Last night I went to a social event with just friends, like people my age and these are friends that we usually hang out with. But everyone's drinking a lot of alcohol. And when people do that, it becomes really hard to understand them because they start using slang and swear words and their voice starts to go all like this. Even if you are like a chinese speaker still, sometimes when people are drunk, it's a little bit difficult. Sometimes when I go out, I get a little bit frustrated because I just want to have fun and make jokes. But I'm like, I don't even know what's going on?", 'speaker B: You cannot imagine.', "speaker A: Yeah, I cannot. People don't make sense, so it's really hard. It's really hard. And when people are hanging out with their friends, they want to sound cool, so they use their young friend voice. You know what I mean? Different words, different kind of voice.

Because I think if he attacked a rock, he will.', 'speaker A: Okay, hold on. Go back. You said, I wonder how he is.', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Dare is not the right word. You could say brave. Yeah, okay. Yeah, for sure. Brave. Also, I think these types of people we kind of call adrenaline junkies, these are people who are addicted to adrenaline. They love adrenaline.

Really?', 'speaker B: Not so dangerous.', "speaker A: Yeah, I'm not into it. I'm not into it. Even today we were riding the motorcycle and I just kept thinking, like, if I buy a motorcycle, it's going to be so funny because I think I will only go to third gear. Like, not even going to use the fifth gear. Do you know what I mean by that?", 'speaker B: I know. Different gears means different speed, right?', "speaker A: So, like, fifth gear is the highest. So it's the highest speed.", 'speaker B: Okay.', "speaker A: So it's like one through five. It depends on the motorcycle. But I just think it's funny because I was thinking today I probably will never use the fifth gear. Yeah. Anyway, by the way, the other thing I was going to say, you said it's cool to watch videos of these people on TikTok, but have you seen the cool videos of figure skaters? These are professional ice skaters.", 'speaker B: Figure.', "speaker A: They are. They're like professional at ice skating. Do you know what I'm talking about?", 'speaker B: Two persons, a man, a woman.', "speaker A: It doesn't have to be two people. Yeah.", 'speaker B: In the circle field.', "speaker A: Well, it can be, but I'll show you. I follow a figure skater that goes to like, what do you say? Like, frozen lakes. And he does the figure skating on frozen lakes.", 'speaker B: Okay.', "speaker A: Yeah. Actually, I cannot find him, but I'll show you later. He's really cool. So people do that. People will go out like, kind of like this kind of place. I know, that's cool, too.", "speaker B: That's cool, too.", "speaker A: Yeah. I think that would be fun. But I think that part of the reason I think it's so boring to go figure like ice skating is because it's just like in a park and you just go in circles, right? And then you just fall down and you laugh and you're like, oh. It's like, okay, now I'm just going to go home and I have a big bruise on my butt. And that's not cute. I don't know. But. Okay, in other years. Not this year, but in other years, did you celebrate Valentine's Day?", 'speaker B: Other years? Yeah, we were in Lanzhou at that time.', "speaker A: Yeah, usually it's like a nice meal or something. Yeah. What about for the new year? I'm curious if the New Year's celebration, the Lunar New Year celebration, is different in China than it is in Taiwan. Do you have a day that you go to both sides of the family?", "speaker B: No, we are in different cities. We haven't been that state to meet each other.", 'speaker A: Okay, so what do you usually do?', "speaker B: I think it's boring. And the most important thing is to play the firewoods.", 'speaker A: Fireworks.', 'speaker B: Fireworks?', "speaker A: Yeah, fireworks. On New Year's Eve?", 'speaker B: What?', "speaker A: On New Year's Eve.", "speaker B: What's the meaning?", "speaker A: New Year's Eve is.", 'speaker B: Right.', "speaker A: Yeah. The day before New Year's Day.", 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Right. So, like, this year, New Year's Eve was on the 9th, February 9. This year. What is your Zodiac?", 'speaker B: Zodiac Nishuzama cough.', "speaker A: Not your year. So you just had a year, though? Yeah, a couple of years ago. Me too. Because I'm the mouse.", "speaker B: Your mouse. You're older than me one year.", "speaker A: Oh, I'm older than you one year. Right. I cannot calculate that. Okay.", 'speaker B: Hmm.', "speaker A: I didn't know that. I thought you were older than me, actually. Okay.", 'speaker B: I watched breaking bad, and I know how to say there is.']`

['speaker A: It. Okay, I got it. You want to talk about it, or are you private?', "speaker B: No, I don't care.", "speaker A: I just mean, like, we have different ways of saying it. So you can say, like, I've broke up with her, she broke up with me. Or just general is we broke up. Or we also say, like, I dumped her or she dumped me, but that one is a little bit too direct. Like, that one's kind of harsh. Like, pretty aggressive way to say that. Yeah. Now what happens? Do you feel like, did you guys share a lot of things? So do you have to kind of divide anything or something, or you just won't talk to her again?", "speaker B: It's complex. At the beginning, we deleted our WeChat contact, but totally, it was a peaceful division.", "speaker A: Oh, you said you deleted each other's WeChat contact?", 'speaker B: Yeah, at the beginning, we met each other and we talked a lot, and finally we decided to delete the contact. But yesterday he added me again.', 'speaker A: She added you again yesterday?', 'speaker B: Yeah, she added me again because I. There was still some normal things she wanted to ask for me.', "speaker A: Okay. You could say maybe, like, some practical questions. Yeah. Okay. And by the way, when you say met, usually in English, we don't use it like that because met kind of means, like ranchita. Yeah. So you can say met up with, like, met up with her. Okay, cool. So you met up with her so that you guys could discuss or about it. Okay. Well, at least you guys don't share a house or something because that would be difficult to deal with all that. Because I had a friend last year who broke up with her boyfriend, but then they were sharing an apartment in both paying rent for the apartment. And then it was really stressful because she had to find a new place to live very fast because he wanted to stay in the apartment. That's hard. Yeah. So did she meet your family before? Do you have to tell your family?", 'speaker B: Not yet.', 'speaker A: She had never met your family before, right?', 'speaker B: Yes, even before we had a relationship for almost four years.', 'speaker A: Whoa. So she never met your family?', 'speaker B: Yeah, same with me.', "speaker A: Oh, that's interesting. Is it common to not meet each other's families for four years?", "speaker B: It's common because we still pursued our degree after that period.", "speaker A: Okay. My family met my boyfriend just, like, two months after we started dating. But I get you. Maybe it's different there, especially if you're going to school.", "speaker B: Anyway. I think far from each other, it's tougher in a relationship.", "speaker A: Yeah. Long distance is really difficult. It puts a lot of pressure on the relationship. Sometimes we call those LDR. It's a long distance relationship. Yeah. And they're really difficult. They're really difficult. So now do you feel like you will want a big break before you start dating again, or do you plan to start dating again?", "speaker B: I plan to, but actually, I don't have actual plan.", "speaker A: Right. But I just feel sometimes people maybe even take like one year break dating or maybe like six months break before they start going on dates again. But then other people just feel like, don't need to wait, just start dating again. It just depends how much your heart needs to heal or maybe how your heart heals. Because I think some people can heal faster if they just do it on their own. And then some people need to go out and find new people to know.", 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Okay. Well, I'm sorry it's been such a hard month, but I'm sending you cool new lady vibes. Okay. What's dating like in Beijing? What do people do? Do people use dating apps?", 'speaker B: Oh, yeah.', "speaker A: Is that mostly the way people date now? I feel like in Taiwan people use dating apps, but I think people meet through each other's friend network here most of the time, which is not true in the US. People don't really do that in the US as much. What's it like? Well, because I don't know. Unless you're really sure that your friend is going to do well with another friend. I just don't really see any young people doing that. Maybe the older generation, but we don't really do that anymore. I don't know. But I think that's a bad thing because then people only use the apps and they just swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe. So the dating apps in the US, a lot of the, like, there are different apps that people use depending on what they want. Like if they want to hook up. Do you know what that. Okay, if you want to hook up, then you might use one app. But if you want a long term relationship, long term relationship, like maybe looking for something serious, then you use a different app.", 'speaker B: Okay.', "speaker A: And there are also different apps if you're like, gay or straight.", "speaker B: I know. Gay. There's a blue app.", 'speaker A: What blue app?', "speaker B: I don't know, but chinese homo.", 'speaker A: China has a gay dating app.', "speaker B: I don't know if it's in Chinese. IOS App Store in abroad, but I have a friend using it.", 'speaker A: Really?', 'speaker B: He call it small blue.', 'speaker A: Small blue.', 'speaker B: Maybe it has a blue logo or something.', "speaker A: A blue logo? Yeah. I know the most popular one in the US has a yellow label and it's called Grindr. This is like the most popular one for the gay community. Yeah, but like that one, it's a lot of hooking up. So people mostly just use that for hooking up. But the other ones that are most popular in the US for anyone is Tinder or hinge.", 'speaker B: I know Tinder because I downloaded TikTok and I paid attention to the Apple rank in the US App Stores. App Store.', 'speaker A: Oh, does it rank very high?', 'speaker B: Yeah. Publish.', "speaker A: Yeah, because a lot of people use this for dating now. And it's kind of weird because you used to be able to just go out and then a guy would think you were cute and he would just walk up to you and be like, hey, girl, I think you're cute. Can I get your number? And now men are really shy and they just use the apps because they think it feels better since they cannot get rejected. Harsh. Yeah. But I think it's kind of sad. So for me, I think it's really sweet when guys just see someone they like and they just go talk to them because it feels like, so real. I don't know.", 'speaker B: You know what you like? You prefer. You prefer in person?', "speaker A: Yeah. I just feel like people are so scared to talk to people these days. I don't know if it's the same in China. I just feel since social.", 'speaker B: More conservative in China, actually.', "speaker A: Yeah, probably. Yeah. I think in the US it's because of social media, because everyone's used to talking on their phones and then they got shy to do it in real life because they can use their phone and just say any crazy thing they want. You know what I mean? So people get cocky on their phone and they start saying all sorts of dirty things, and then you see them in person and they're like, oh, you know what I mean? Yeah, it's probably true there, too. I bet men on the dating apps are really direct. You don't think so? I think so. Must be okay. Sorry.", 'speaker B: Anyway, have you been to Romania?', 'speaker A: Romania?', 'speaker B: Yeah.', 'speaker A: Like this. No. Yeah. Why?', 'speaker B: This weekend I attended an activity about Romanian Valentine.', 'speaker A: Activity? Do you mean huo dong?', 'speaker B: Right.', 'speaker A: Event. You can say event. Yeah, it was about Romania.', 'speaker B: Yeah. And the romanian ambassador in China also attended this event.', "speaker A: Okay, and what's happening in Romania?", 'speaker B: What type?', "speaker A: Like, what's happening in. Why? Why was there an event about Romania?", 'speaker B: Because last Sunday is their Valentine Day. So there was a special event for.', "speaker A: Valentine's Day with the ambassador.", 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: That's so strange. What did they do at the event?", 'speaker B: There were some shows, fashion show and a singer in Romania and famous host in Romania.', 'speaker A: That sounds fun. So you went to the event?', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: That's really fun. Was there like dancing or something? Since there was a concert?", 'speaker B: Not a dancer, just the same dancing people like you.', 'speaker A: Did you dance?', "speaker B: No, I don't.", "speaker A: You don't like to dance?", "speaker B: I can't. But recently I knew a girl who also learned to speak English.", "speaker A: You don't say. New girl. Recently I knew a girl recently I met up with. No. Did you just meet her?", 'speaker B: No. Make a friend.', 'speaker A: Okay. Nijaj Shimpangyo.', 'speaker B: All right.', 'speaker A: So then you met her?', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Okay. I don't know your meaning, but you can say I've been talking to a girl who is also learning English.", 'speaker B: Yeah. And she dances very well. Yeah. She can teach me how to dance. Some basic dance.', "speaker A: Dancing is so fun and it's really good for your body. Like, dancers are so strong and they have good cardio and they're flexible and it's just so fun to do. Social. What kind of dance does she know how to do?", 'speaker B: Latin.', 'speaker A: Latin dancing? Maybe like salsa or.', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: It'S one of those. Which one?", 'speaker B: There are many kinds of dance. Heat shapes.', 'speaker A: She can do more than one?', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Okay. I took salsa dancing lessons and it was so much fun. I think that latin music is the most fun music to dance to. But the girl you met, she's Chinese or where is she from? She's Chinese. She works with you?", "speaker B: No, she's preparing for learning abroad.", 'speaker A: Studying abroad?', "speaker B: Yeah, study abroad. She's going to irish college. Irish college. University.", "speaker A: Okay. An irish university. Good. Because if it's the country. What do you call the country?", "speaker B: I don't know. I run.", 'speaker A: Say it again. I run Ireland.', 'speaker B: Ireland. Okay.', "speaker A: Yeah. Okay. That's really cool. So is she younger than you or is she going to get her master's degree?", "speaker B: Yeah, but. Master's degree. But she's older than me because she has worked.", "speaker A: Yeah. She's going to get her master's degree. Ireland is interesting. I don't love Ireland. It rains a lot. It really rains a lot. And the people drink too much alcohol.", 'speaker B: Cloudy and overcast.', "speaker A: Yeah, true. I think people are just bored because there's not a lot to do in Ireland, so I think people get bored. I don't that I feel that, but that's cool. She's like, of course, in Dublin or something. There's going to be so much to do. And even Galway is a really young city. Her English is really good.", 'speaker B: Not that good.', 'speaker A: So not as good as you. Maybe worse than you.', 'speaker B: Yeah. Because she just began to prepare.', 'speaker A: Have you ever thought about studying in a different country?', 'speaker B: You may say. You may say me her. Mia.', 'speaker A: Have you ever considered.', 'speaker B: I had a plan before because in China, so many people got a job in us by the internship when they pursued degree in us. But now this way is. So this. I have given up this sword.', 'speaker A: Okay. The grammar for the plan would be. I had planned to study abroad before, but I decided not to. Like that. I had planned to study abroad before.', 'speaker B: I got it perfect, actually.', "speaker A: Yeah, I know what you're saying because it is really difficult now. My boyfriend got his master's degree in the US and then he worked for a company for one year in something they call the opt. You know? Opt.", 'speaker B: I know.', "speaker A: So the company sponsored him. They sponsored him to get the h one b. But the government still said no because they had too many people that applied that year. So even though he did everything, they still say no. Yeah. So I don't recommend. I think Australia is really.", "speaker B: When many people choose Canada. Canada. But I know Canada's salary is not that high. Maybe it's not costly, effective for programming and it's cold.", "speaker A: But Australia is warm and they have a pretty high minimum wage. I think so. So it's not bad. And they have a really open immigration policy. I know some people who have immigrated there and are really happy that they did. I'm not saying you have to study there, but when I went to this city, there were so many chinese people. Like, if I closed my eyes, I would think that I'm in China because I hear so much Chinese when I'm walking on the street. Because I left Taiwan and I went to Australia and I thought I just left Taiwan, but I still hear so much Chinese. I feel like, why am I still in Taiwan? It was so crazy.", 'speaker B: Wow.', "speaker A: Yeah. A lot of people there. But I think that's a really good sign. Right? Because that probably means it's a really good place to study anyway, you can think about it.", 'speaker B: Yeah. I want to immigrate abroad, actually.', 'speaker A: Or study abroad.', 'speaker B: Immigrant.', "speaker A: No, immigrant. Okay, good. Immigrate. Yes. You're seriously considering that?", 'speaker B: Yeah. But if you want to do a choice, you need to have to.', 'speaker A: What?', "speaker B: That's a big. Actually, because most are about finance. I think in China, my family has business, I have salary. Maybe in the first tier city we can have a good life. But if I migrate abroad, maybe the income will decrease.", 'speaker A: You mean if you move to another country, then you will not receive as much money from your family company?', 'speaker B: Yeah.', 'speaker A: They will give you less money if you choose to leave China.', "speaker B: No, that's not what you. For example, whether you live in Beijing or Melbourne, actually, maybe the life quality are same.", "speaker A: So you mean if I move to, like, let's say Australia, for example, if I move to Australia, the cost of living will be higher, right? Yeah, the cost of living is higher and so you won't be able to live as comfortably.", 'speaker B: Maybe. How to say, physical life. Maybe physical life. Yeah. What I want to say is you lose your culture background and your friendship network. The good thing is you can be more free or.', 'speaker A: Liberal. Not liberal, but you can say liberated or free. Yeah. Do you often feel, how can I say?', 'speaker B: Controlled?', "speaker A: Yeah. I don't know how to say it in a nice way, but do you often feel that in China? Because I always feel like when I talk to chinese people, they only say nice things about their government or about myself.", "speaker B: Yeah. For myself, not that oppressed, but for some policies and system, I actually don't agree with their enforcement.", "speaker A: Okay, I understand. But what you're saying is that you feel like it doesn't affect you as much as it affects other people, but it still bothers you that the policy is hacked. Yeah, I understand that. There's a lot like that in the US, too. But I feel like a lot of the time when I've considered moving to a different country, it's because I really like the lifestyle there more. And I feel like recently, I don't want to live in the US because people are too.", 'speaker B: Hectic.', 'speaker A: What?', 'speaker B: Hectic?', "speaker A: Yeah, hectic. But also we have a really toxic culture about politics, race, the LGBTQ community, about everything. Our culture is just very messed up right now. And I feel like it's because people are focused on really small societal things and nobody can focus on real world things. Just, like, go out and enjoy kind of.", 'speaker B: What would I say? Pay much attention to it.', 'speaker A: Yeah. This is like political correctness, right?', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Political correctness is what we call that kind of political correctness. But also, people are just very wrong right now in general. And I feel like a lot of the time, people want my opinion on some issues, and I feel so annoyed. I'm like, why? We have to talk about that. Let's go do something fun.", "speaker B: And you don't think you can change it by the group? People like you vote for something.", "speaker A: I totally know what you're saying, but I feel like it's just more difficult to find that in the US because even if you have that group's a friend, you still go out and constantly there's, like, noise about know. Okay. Anyway, have a good night. Sending you love.", 'speaker B: Thank you.']`

                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```

['speaker A: It. Okay, I got it. You want to talk about it, or are you private?', "speaker B: No, I don't care.", "speaker A: I just mean, like, we have different ways of saying it. So you can say, like, I've broke up with her, she broke up with me. Or just general is we broke up. Or we also say, like, I dumped her or she dumped me, but that one is a little bit too direct. Like, that one's kind of harsh. Like, pretty aggressive way to say that. Yeah. Now what happens? Do you feel like, did you guys share a lot of things? So do you have to kind of divide anything or something, or you just won't talk to her again?", "speaker B: It's complex. At the beginning, we deleted our WeChat contact, but totally, it was a peaceful division.", "speaker A: Oh, you said you deleted each other's WeChat contact?", 'speaker B: Yeah, at the beginning, we met each other and we talked a lot, and finally we decided to delete the contact. But yesterday he added me again.', 'speaker A: She added you again yesterday?', 'speaker B: Yeah, she added me again because I. There was still some normal things she wanted to ask for me.', "speaker A: Okay. You could say maybe, like, some practical questions. Yeah. Okay. And by the way, when you say met, usually in English, we don't use it like that because met kind of means, like ranchita. Yeah. So you can say met up with, like, met up with her. Okay, cool. So you met up with her so that you guys could discuss or about it. Okay. Well, at least you guys don't share a house or something because that would be difficult to deal with all that. Because I had a friend last year who broke up with her boyfriend, but then they were sharing an apartment in both paying rent for the apartment. And then it was really stressful because she had to find a new place to live very fast because he wanted to stay in the apartment. That's hard. Yeah. So did she meet your family before? Do you have to tell your family?", 'speaker B: Not yet.', 'speaker A: She had never met your family before, right?', 'speaker B: Yes, even before we had a relationship for almost four years.', 'speaker A: Whoa. So she never met your family?', 'speaker B: Yeah, same with me.', "speaker A: Oh, that's interesting. Is it common to not meet each other's families for four years?", "speaker B: It's common because we still pursued our degree after that period.", "speaker A: Okay. My family met my boyfriend just, like, two months after we started dating. But I get you. Maybe it's different there, especially if you're going to school.", "speaker B: Anyway. I think far from each other, it's tougher in a relationship.", "speaker A: Yeah. Long distance is really difficult. It puts a lot of pressure on the relationship. Sometimes we call those LDR. It's a long distance relationship. Yeah. And they're really difficult. They're really difficult. So now do you feel like you will want a big break before you start dating again, or do you plan to start dating again?", "speaker B: I plan to, but actually, I don't have actual plan.", "speaker A: Right. But I just feel sometimes people maybe even take like one year break dating or maybe like six months break before they start going on dates again. But then other people just feel like, don't need to wait, just start dating again. It just depends how much your heart needs to heal or maybe how your heart heals. Because I think some people can heal faster if they just do it on their own. And then some people need to go out and find new people to know.", 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Okay. Well, I'm sorry it's been such a hard month, but I'm sending you cool new lady vibes. Okay. What's dating like in Beijing? What do people do? Do people use dating apps?", 'speaker B: Oh, yeah.', "speaker A: Is that mostly the way people date now? I feel like in Taiwan people use dating apps, but I think people meet through each other's friend network here most of the time, which is not true in the US. People don't really do that in the US as much. What's it like? Well, because I don't know. Unless you're really sure that your friend is going to do well with another friend. I just don't really see any young people doing that. Maybe the older generation, but we don't really do that anymore. I don't know. But I think that's a bad thing because then people only use the apps and they just swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe. So the dating apps in the US, a lot of the, like, there are different apps that people use depending on what they want. Like if they want to hook up. Do you know what that. Okay, if you want to hook up, then you might use one app. But if you want a long term relationship, long term relationship, like maybe looking for something serious, then you use a different app.", 'speaker B: Okay.', "speaker A: And there are also different apps if you're like, gay or straight.", "speaker B: I know. Gay. There's a blue app.", 'speaker A: What blue app?', "speaker B: I don't know, but chinese homo.", 'speaker A: China has a gay dating app.', "speaker B: I don't know if it's in Chinese. IOS App Store in abroad, but I have a friend using it.", 'speaker A: Really?', 'speaker B: He call it small blue.', 'speaker A: Small blue.', 'speaker B: Maybe it has a blue logo or something.', "speaker A: A blue logo? Yeah. I know the most popular one in the US has a yellow label and it's called Grindr. This is like the most popular one for the gay community. Yeah, but like that one, it's a lot of hooking up. So people mostly just use that for hooking up. But the other ones that are most popular in the US for anyone is Tinder or hinge.", 'speaker B: I know Tinder because I downloaded TikTok and I paid attention to the Apple rank in the US App Stores. App Store.', 'speaker A: Oh, does it rank very high?', 'speaker B: Yeah. Publish.', "speaker A: Yeah, because a lot of people use this for dating now. And it's kind of weird because you used to be able to just go out and then a guy would think you were cute and he would just walk up to you and be like, hey, girl, I think you're cute. Can I get your number? And now men are really shy and they just use the apps because they think it feels better since they cannot get rejected. Harsh. Yeah. But I think it's kind of sad. So for me, I think it's really sweet when guys just see someone they like and they just go talk to them because it feels like, so real. I don't know.", 'speaker B: You know what you like? You prefer. You prefer in person?', "speaker A: Yeah. I just feel like people are so scared to talk to people these days. I don't know if it's the same in China. I just feel since social.", 'speaker B: More conservative in China, actually.', "speaker A: Yeah, probably. Yeah. I think in the US it's because of social media, because everyone's used to talking on their phones and then they got shy to do it in real life because they can use their phone and just say any crazy thing they want. You know what I mean? So people get cocky on their phone and they start saying all sorts of dirty things, and then you see them in person and they're like, oh, you know what I mean? Yeah, it's probably true there, too. I bet men on the dating apps are really direct. You don't think so? I think so. Must be okay. Sorry.", 'speaker B: Anyway, have you been to Romania?', 'speaker A: Romania?', 'speaker B: Yeah.', 'speaker A: Like this. No. Yeah. Why?', 'speaker B: This weekend I attended an activity about Romanian Valentine.', 'speaker A: Activity? Do you mean huo dong?', 'speaker B: Right.', 'speaker A: Event. You can say event. Yeah, it was about Romania.', 'speaker B: Yeah. And the romanian ambassador in China also attended this event.', "speaker A: Okay, and what's happening in Romania?", 'speaker B: What type?', "speaker A: Like, what's happening in. Why? Why was there an event about Romania?", 'speaker B: Because last Sunday is their Valentine Day. So there was a special event for.', "speaker A: Valentine's Day with the ambassador.", 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: That's so strange. What did they do at the event?", 'speaker B: There were some shows, fashion show and a singer in Romania and famous host in Romania.', 'speaker A: That sounds fun. So you went to the event?', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: That's really fun. Was there like dancing or something? Since there was a concert?", 'speaker B: Not a dancer, just the same dancing people like you.', 'speaker A: Did you dance?', "speaker B: No, I don't.", "speaker A: You don't like to dance?", "speaker B: I can't. But recently I knew a girl who also learned to speak English.", "speaker A: You don't say. New girl. Recently I knew a girl recently I met up with. No. Did you just meet her?", 'speaker B: No. Make a friend.', 'speaker A: Okay. Nijaj Shimpangyo.', 'speaker B: All right.', 'speaker A: So then you met her?', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Okay. I don't know your meaning, but you can say I've been talking to a girl who is also learning English.", 'speaker B: Yeah. And she dances very well. Yeah. She can teach me how to dance. Some basic dance.', "speaker A: Dancing is so fun and it's really good for your body. Like, dancers are so strong and they have good cardio and they're flexible and it's just so fun to do. Social. What kind of dance does she know how to do?", 'speaker B: Latin.', 'speaker A: Latin dancing? Maybe like salsa or.', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: It'S one of those. Which one?", 'speaker B: There are many kinds of dance. Heat shapes.', 'speaker A: She can do more than one?', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Okay. I took salsa dancing lessons and it was so much fun. I think that latin music is the most fun music to dance to. But the girl you met, she's Chinese or where is she from? She's Chinese. She works with you?", "speaker B: No, she's preparing for learning abroad.", 'speaker A: Studying abroad?', "speaker B: Yeah, study abroad. She's going to irish college. Irish college. University.", "speaker A: Okay. An irish university. Good. Because if it's the country. What do you call the country?", "speaker B: I don't know. I run.", 'speaker A: Say it again. I run Ireland.', 'speaker B: Ireland. Okay.', "speaker A: Yeah. Okay. That's really cool. So is she younger than you or is she going to get her master's degree?", "speaker B: Yeah, but. Master's degree. But she's older than me because she has worked.", "speaker A: Yeah. She's going to get her master's degree. Ireland is interesting. I don't love Ireland. It rains a lot. It really rains a lot. And the people drink too much alcohol.", 'speaker B: Cloudy and overcast.', "speaker A: Yeah, true. I think people are just bored because there's not a lot to do in Ireland, so I think people get bored. I don't that I feel that, but that's cool. She's like, of course, in Dublin or something. There's going to be so much to do. And even Galway is a really young city. Her English is really good.", 'speaker B: Not that good.', 'speaker A: So not as good as you. Maybe worse than you.', 'speaker B: Yeah. Because she just began to prepare.', 'speaker A: Have you ever thought about studying in a different country?', 'speaker B: You may say. You may say me her. Mia.', 'speaker A: Have you ever considered.', 'speaker B: I had a plan before because in China, so many people got a job in us by the internship when they pursued degree in us. But now this way is. So this. I have given up this sword.', 'speaker A: Okay. The grammar for the plan would be. I had planned to study abroad before, but I decided not to. Like that. I had planned to study abroad before.', 'speaker B: I got it perfect, actually.', "speaker A: Yeah, I know what you're saying because it is really difficult now. My boyfriend got his master's degree in the US and then he worked for a company for one year in something they call the opt. You know? Opt.", 'speaker B: I know.', "speaker A: So the company sponsored him. They sponsored him to get the h one b. But the government still said no because they had too many people that applied that year. So even though he did everything, they still say no. Yeah. So I don't recommend. I think Australia is really.", "speaker B: When many people choose Canada. Canada. But I know Canada's salary is not that high. Maybe it's not costly, effective for programming and it's cold.", "speaker A: But Australia is warm and they have a pretty high minimum wage. I think so. So it's not bad. And they have a really open immigration policy. I know some people who have immigrated there and are really happy that they did. I'm not saying you have to study there, but when I went to this city, there were so many chinese people. Like, if I closed my eyes, I would think that I'm in China because I hear so much Chinese when I'm walking on the street. Because I left Taiwan and I went to Australia and I thought I just left Taiwan, but I still hear so much Chinese. I feel like, why am I still in Taiwan? It was so crazy.", 'speaker B: Wow.', "speaker A: Yeah. A lot of people there. But I think that's a really good sign. Right? Because that probably means it's a really good place to study anyway, you can think about it.", 'speaker B: Yeah. I want to immigrate abroad, actually.', 'speaker A: Or study abroad.', 'speaker B: Immigrant.', "speaker A: No, immigrant. Okay, good. Immigrate. Yes. You're seriously considering that?", 'speaker B: Yeah. But if you want to do a choice, you need to have to.', 'speaker A: What?', "speaker B: That's a big. Actually, because most are about finance. I think in China, my family has business, I have salary. Maybe in the first tier city we can have a good life. But if I migrate abroad, maybe the income will decrease.", 'speaker A: You mean if you move to another country, then you will not receive as much money from your family company?', 'speaker B: Yeah.', 'speaker A: They will give you less money if you choose to leave China.', "speaker B: No, that's not what you. For example, whether you live in Beijing or Melbourne, actually, maybe the life quality are same.", "speaker A: So you mean if I move to, like, let's say Australia, for example, if I move to Australia, the cost of living will be higher, right? Yeah, the cost of living is higher and so you won't be able to live as comfortably.", 'speaker B: Maybe. How to say, physical life. Maybe physical life. Yeah. What I want to say is you lose your culture background and your friendship network. The good thing is you can be more free or.', 'speaker A: Liberal. Not liberal, but you can say liberated or free. Yeah. Do you often feel, how can I say?', 'speaker B: Controlled?', "speaker A: Yeah. I don't know how to say it in a nice way, but do you often feel that in China? Because I always feel like when I talk to chinese people, they only say nice things about their government or about myself.", "speaker B: Yeah. For myself, not that oppressed, but for some policies and system, I actually don't agree with their enforcement.", "speaker A: Okay, I understand. But what you're saying is that you feel like it doesn't affect you as much as it affects other people, but it still bothers you that the policy is hacked. Yeah, I understand that. There's a lot like that in the US, too. But I feel like a lot of the time when I've considered moving to a different country, it's because I really like the lifestyle there more. And I feel like recently, I don't want to live in the US because people are too.", 'speaker B: Hectic.', 'speaker A: What?', 'speaker B: Hectic?', "speaker A: Yeah, hectic. But also we have a really toxic culture about politics, race, the LGBTQ community, about everything. Our culture is just very messed up right now. And I feel like it's because people are focused on really small societal things and nobody can focus on real world things. Just, like, go out and enjoy kind of.", 'speaker B: What would I say? Pay much attention to it.', 'speaker A: Yeah. This is like political correctness, right?', 'speaker B: Yeah.', "speaker A: Political correctness is what we call that kind of political correctness. But also, people are just very wrong right now in general. And I feel like a lot of the time, people want my opinion on some issues, and I feel so annoyed. I'm like, why? We have to talk about that. Let's go do something fun.", "speaker B: And you don't think you can change it by the group? People like you vote for something.", "speaker A: I totally know what you're saying, but I feel like it's just more difficult to find that in the US because even if you have that group's a friend, you still go out and constantly there's, like, noise about know. Okay. Anyway, have a good night. Sending you love.", 'speaker B: Thank you.']`

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

Last month, when I came back to Beijing, I took a taxi to, say, the Tian square and other streets in front of Tianan Square. That core area is so old.', "speaker B: It's very old.

I'm so happy that I did not do it. I'm really happy I did not do it. But usually, of course there are different military bases in different places. So we call military base like a military base is where it's.", "speaker A: What'S happening. You mean the camp or the amount of military.", "speaker B: So military base is just talking about the place that you would be stationed which means it's basically talking about the permanent spot for the military.", 'speaker A: Like that island you mentioned before, a Penghu Guangdao we call it.', 'speaker B: Oh, Guangdao.', "speaker A: You say megwo military base or that's Guam Guangdao.", "speaker B: Yeah. Oh, I thought you were talking about. Because in Taiwan pung Hu is known for. Yeah, like Guam for this. This. It's like a facility the area where the military owns it and it's all operated by the military. Right. And so it's kind of like we're one of the branches of the military. They have the equipment and the soldiers and they do training and they work. Yeah, that's military base.", 'speaker A: Did your boyfriend take?', 'speaker B: He had to. Yeah. Because in Taiwan you have went to.

When the party, previous party in Taiwan went out of mainland, they went to Taiwan. Right. But Taiwan is far from mainland, almost 200. They also occupied Jimmy at that time. But mainland military didn't take over Jimmy because they saw that maybe it was a connection between Taiwan and mainland.", "speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting because Jinmen is kind of far from Taiwan. It's really close to China, so it does feel really interesting. I know. I had a friend who lived in Jinmen to teach English, and she said it's like, really weird to live. Know a lot of people, when they think of Jinmen, they only think about military and Galiang. You know, Galiang, the alcohol, Galang tiao. You mean Galiang Tiao? Yeah. So people mostly just think about Jinmen for this. I think military and Galionjiu. Yeah, but not for Guam. Also Guam is famous were like that military. But.", "speaker A: What a japanese island. Guantao. Isn't it Guam?", "speaker B: No. Are we thinking about a different island? Guam is the US island. It's the United States.", "speaker A: It's United States. I know the military is american.", "speaker B: Yeah, I suppose it's a territory of the.", 'speaker A: Oh, okay.', "speaker B: Yeah. So we don't call it a state.

It's not a. Yeah, but it's funny because like I told you, I never considered taking a vacation to Guam. But now I've heard so many asian people say that they will take the vacation to Guam, and I think, oh, that's so interesting. I kind of want to go now. It sounds cool. It sounds spice.", "speaker A: Maybe it's what some are. Spice, some vinegars are spies.", 'speaker B: What do you mean? Oh, spies. Spies. Spies. Spies. Yeah, it could be, but I think they will waste a little bit of time in Guam. Yeah, there are a lot of spies in Washington, DC. A lot. I think people say, like, the highest population of spies are in DC. Yeah, I used to live in DC, and me and my boyfriend, we used to go out and guess who was a spy.', "speaker A: But you can't exactly find out.", "speaker B: Yeah, we cannot find out, but we would just create stories for different people and be like, oh, this person, maybe Chinese. Definitely a lot of chinese spies in Washington DC for, um. But you said you're going to Phuket next month. Are you going with people or are you going? Just you?", 'speaker A: With my colleague.', "speaker B: That's fun. Is it a man or woman? Colleague.", 'speaker A: A man are the majority.', 'speaker B: Oh, colleagues.', "speaker A: You're going colleagues? Yeah, with my team, actually.", "speaker B: Okay. That's a fun trip. Are you kidding? Is it organized by your company or you guys? Organized it on your own by my.", 'speaker A: Team, not the whole company.', 'speaker B: Okay.

Is it just a chinese app or.', 'speaker A: Is it international trip? Yeah, maybe we are the same group. We also have broad business, but now most users are the Chinese. They go abroad in Utah.', "speaker B: Interesting. Cool. That's so nice. Perfect. I'm just. I've just decided to go to the Philippines, but I almost went to Phuket as well. But I think it would take longer for me to get to Phuket. And so I just thought it's only five days, so I don't want to travel too long.", 'speaker A: The biggest difference between those two islands, what are the most different points between Phuket and Boraque?', "speaker B: I've never been to Boricay before, but I know Thailand. I think thai food is so good. Do you like thai food?", 'speaker A: I knew I tried Thais maybe.', "speaker B: I think it's super good. I think it's super good. But I don't know what Philippines food is. Like. What is it? I never had it before, so I don't really know what to expect. But to be honest with, like, the week after I go to the Philippines, my whole family is coming to Taiwan. So in the honestly, like, I plan to do the same as you, I will just go to the beach and lay down the whole, like, I just want to rest. I really just want to rest and swim in the water, maybe surf a little bit, maybe do some snorkeling. Do you think you will do some water sports or something in phuket, like snorkeling?", 'speaker A: I want to scoop diving again because last time there was a heavy wave in the grotto. How do you say in the grotto? In the ground of the sea, like in the bottom.', 'speaker B: Okay. Riptide.', 'speaker A: Yeah.', "speaker B: Or undercurrent. Yeah. So it's dangerous.", 'speaker A: No, I mean, when I reach the ground of sea, I almost can say anything.', 'speaker B: Because the waves were too heavy.', 'speaker A: Because of wave it.', "speaker B: Oh, I didn't know that was a thing. Okay. Yeah. So when the waves go to, the pressure from the waves hits the bottom of the ocean and kind of makes the sand and everything move around so you can. Wow. Okay. Interesting. Okay, so you want to try again and see if it's more clear. But I've never been scuba diving before. I've only done snorkeling. And I guess I felt a little bit nervous to go scuba diving. Is it scary?", 'speaker A: Yeah. Too quiet.', 'speaker B: Yeah, totally.', 'speaker A: Too broad.', "speaker B: It feels kind of eerie. Do you know that word? Eerie? It feels kind of like dud. I feel like when I'm under the water, I will just be looking around for shark.", 'speaker A: Yeah. There will be a trainer tied with you.', 'speaker B: Okay.', 'speaker A: You can just control your eyes about the motion. It was took over by the trainer.', "speaker B: Okay. It's still intimidating to me, but I think I would try it. But maybe I would try it in Taiwan before Philippines, because I know at least I can communicate better and maybe I know the Taiwan laws a little bit more just because if you go to a different country, sometimes they don't take care of. Actually, I think Bali is kind of famous for this.", 'speaker A: Bali. Bali doll.', 'speaker B: Yeah, Bali doll. I know a lot of people who have gone to Bali and, like, some things.', 'speaker A: Robber.', "speaker B: Yeah. Things like. And the. The police officers don't really protect them very will just. I'll try it in Taiwan first, the scuba diving. Maybe not Philippines, but that's so cool that you're going to go do the scuba diving. I'm excited for you to tell me how it is. Do you really like fish in the ocean?", "speaker A: I don't really. I don't like other creatures. I don't like cats.", "speaker B: You don't like animals?", 'speaker A: Yeah.', "speaker B: You don't like animals. Okay.", "speaker A: I don't know why, but I don't like them.", "speaker B: That's so funny. Okay. But it's still cool to do the ocean thing. Do you like plants or nature or something?", "speaker A: I don't care, plants. But I don't like animals.", "speaker B: Okay. I don't care, plants.
