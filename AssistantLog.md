                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

**Assistant**:
The JSON response provided is complete and contains suggestions and tags for each round of dialogue you provided. Since the sequence ended at round 9 with "speaker A: And they're like. They're.", there isn't a continuation to provide further.

However, if you have more dialogue that you'd like to be reviewed, please feel free to include it and I'll be happy to continue providing suggestions and tags for additional rounds of conversation.
