We have mushrooms here too. And it's true. Some of them are like, you can eat them and they're toxic. Like, deadly. You can actually die from eating them. They're really bad for you. But some of them, and we usually call these shrooms, they're hallucinogenic. How do I spell that? I have to figure out how to spell this. Okay, hallucinogenic, which means that you can kind of see things that aren't there. And it's like a drug, like you said. Like a drug. Oh, shoot. Keep talking. My laptop is going to die. I'm getting my charger. But keep talking. I can hear you. Yes. So these, like, these mushrooms. These mushrooms are like, people take them for fun. Probably not in China, but in here, people take them for fun.
