A: First big snow of the well, yeah, it hasn't snowed very much, but it's still the first one this year, so it's cold. It's cold. I just want to feel cozy. It's not that cold in Beijing yet.
B: It's also so cold. Also the first snow this winter.

A: Oh, you did have the first snow. Do you like snow?
B: I like but when I evoke the snow had been over. I knew it from the moment in.

A: Which I okay, so you didn't get to see it, so it all melted too quickly.
B: Right.

A: Okay. Yeah. It doesn't look like it's melting outside. It looks like it's just going up and up and up. It's getting a lot thicker. Luckily, I don't really have to drive anywhere today, so that's nice. In China, when it snows, do you guys get some break from work or something?
B: Depends on the extent.

A: Yeah. Right. If it's like, a lot of snow, then maybe yeah. Right now there are a lot of snow plows outside that are clearing the streets. The snow plows.
B: On the street?

A: Say that again?
B: Porcelain salt.

A: Yeah, porcelain salt on the street. Yeah. They also have something that pushes the snow off of the street. Yeah. And the salt is to make sure there's no, like, ice.
B: Yeah, we call it civil engineering.

A: Say that again?
B: This department is called a civil engineering department.

A: Okay, right. For clearing the snow.
B: Yeah.

A: Okay, sure. Yeah. Well, usually here, I don't know, it's pretty simple. The snow plows go on the road, and they clear the snow, and then people can go out. But if it's a lot of snow, because sometimes where I live, it's like lot of snow, like, not just a little bit of snow, then school is canceled. And also, sometimes you can work from home if it's really dangerous to drive on the streets. Yeah, if it's too dangerous to drive on the streets, then sometimes companies will let you work from home. But not always. But it happens sometimes. And definitely people get some time off school. I remember we call them snow days. So snow days are days that you don't have to go to school because it snowed too much. And when you were a kid and it would snow a lot, you will wake up in the morning and it's like the happiest feeling ever to wake up. And you don't have to go to school because of the snow. And then you just go outside and you play in the snow with your friends all day.
B: Okay.

A: Did you have that in China, too?
B: Yeah, I remember in the year maybe 2008 or nine, the whole summer, we just needed to attend school half day because the weather was so hot. So hot. Yeah.

A: It snowed a lot.
B: No, so hot.

A: Oh, it was so hot.
B: Yeah. In the summer.

A: Yeah. Well, I feel like for the snow days, it was really fun for us, because if it was snow day. You didn't have school all day and so you didn't have to do any homework and you could just go out with your friends. If it's a snow day, you call your friends and you're like, it's a snow day, let's go play. And you'd go outside and we'd go sledding. Do you know what sledding is? No, it's not. Is this is something where you sit on something and you go down the hill?
B: Okay.

A: Like this?
B: Yeah.

A: Do you do this in China?
B: I didn't do this, but we will snowball flight.

A: You never did sledding before?
B: Yeah, never.

A: It's so fun. It's so fun. The sledding, you can do it anywhere. So even the town where I lived growing up, they will block a street that has a really big hill so that when it snows in the winter, no cars can drive on the street. Only kids can go sledding on the street. Yes.
B: Last week I traveled to an island in China.

A: Oh, cool. Which island?
B: Hainan.

A: Oh, Hainan. Oh, I've never been there before. Is it cool?
B: I tried to slide on the sea.

A: The what we call slide.
B: Surfing.

A: Oh, chongwan? Yeah, surfing.
B: You have a board?

A: Yeah. In Taiwan I go surfing.
B: I like I can't stand up.

A: Yeah, it's so hard. It's so hard. Yeah, the first time it's really difficult to do it correctly. Yeah, but did you have a teacher? A coach?
B: I have a coach. You had a coach? Yeah, but he was so impatient.

A: Yeah. That's so annoying.
B: When we went out, he told me and my friend that 99% people can't stand up in the first.

A: Really? That's so funny. That's so funny. But did you do it on your knees or something?
B: On my knees?

A: Like, could you do on your knees? Could you get on your knees?
B: What's knees? What is knees?

A: On your knees. Instead of standing on your feet, could you just no. Yeah, it is really difficult. It is really difficult. I did the lessons in Taiwan, maybe like, five. Now I can surf, but I usually need a coach to help me decide where to go in the water to wait for the wave.
B: Okay.

A: So sometimes I still don't know how to position myself correctly. Do you know what I mean?
B: Yeah. From this experience, I learned a new feeling because when you get close to the sea, you will always wear how do you call it? Security suit.

A: Like life jacket?
B: Yeah, life jacket. But in the past I didn't know if it really can work.

A: Oh, like you didn't know if the life jackets worked or not. Oh, did you wear one of these?
B: Yeah, of course.

A: I don't wear one when I go surfing.
B: But when you go surfing, you need to say to the sea in the water, swim. Yeah. So you just swim? Okay.

A: Yeah, I love to swim. I love swimming. I love it. I'm pretty good at swimming because I've been swimming since I was a kid. So even when I was really young, I would swim in the ocean with my family when I.
B: Got out of the speed boat. The life jacket can bring me drift. Yeah, the float. Yeah. The first time I felt so nervous. The first time to get out of there.
A: So you cannot swim? You don't know how to swim?
B: I can swim, but in the sea, I feel so uneven.
A: Yeah. Maybe like the sea, you can feel really vulnerable. I feel vulnerable in the sea. It's difficult because you don't know what is in the water with you. You cannot see inside the water to see if there's some big fish or something you don't know, or maybe some rocks or the big current. The scary thing in the water is if there's riptide, riptide, riptide. Or an undercurrent. Yeah. This is difficult. This is difficult. If I'm in a new place, I only swim where the locals swim because they know where this is. The undercurrent, like the riptide. So if you don't know where it is, it can be a little bit dangerous. Yeah. So that's the only thing maybe I get nervous about when I'm out in the water. Like, I do feel nervous about the about that, but other than that, I feel like pretty okay. Surfing.
B: Yeah.
A: If the waves super big, you.
B: Green.
A: Say that again.
B: Seasick?
A: No, I don't get seasick.
B: I bought package ticket. It included many programs.
A: Say that you bought a package.
B: A ticket.
A: Okay. A ticket for what?
B: Including a lot of programs.
A: You can take party in Hainan.
B: Yeah.
A: Like what other programs?
B: Surfing. Diving. Oh a manny man. You sit on the sea, you have a job under.
A: That's so fun. Did you like the diving? Did you go diving?
B: Yeah, but that day, cause the wave was having so the water under the sea is a little opaque.
A: A little bit what?
B: Don't know.
A: It was a little bit what?
B: Not clear.
A: Okay. The water was not clear.
B: Yeah.
A: Okay, understood. So you couldn't see under the water?
B: Yeah.
A: Okay, got it. I understand. There was like a lot of sediment in there, maybe like a lot in water.
B: Yeah.
A: Okay, so that was when you were diving. So it was difficult to see what was under the water.
B: The sea distance. Within distance.
A: Yeah, to see a distance too long. But did you see, like, fish and stuff?
B: Of course, because we have pocket food. Pocket.
A: Okay. So cute. I love seeing the fish in the water, but I've never gone diving before. I've only done the snorkeling. Yeah. And I love snorkeling, but I don't know, diving makes me a little bit nervous. Isn't it a little bit dangerous?
B: No. Because you have the coach tied with you.
A: Yeah. Okay.
B: So he tells you what to do.
A: So you didn't feel like it was dangerous when you were going?
B: I don't feel dangerous, but I feel when you under a certain depth, you will feel pressure.
A: Right? Exactly.
B: You'll feel pressure of your year, and you need to have some action to balance the pressure.
A: Yeah, but I'm surprised that for the surfing, you needed a life jacket, but it seems like you can swim well enough to do the diving because you have to swim for diving.
B: I needed to swim.
A: You didn't swim.
B: I just do some action, but I cannot control my direction by myself.
A: Oh, really?
B: I have a coach title with me. He can control the direction.
A: Oh, I understand. Okay, so you went with a friend with my colleagues. That's so cool. That's a fun trip to take with your colleagues. So do you feel like you made a friend with your colleagues? Like, are you friends with them?
B: Yeah, we got closer.
A: That's so nice. I love that. That's such a fun trip to do with your colleagues. I've never taken a big trip like that with colleagues before. How far of the flight is Hainan from Beijing?
B: Close to 4 hours.
A: Yeah, it's pretty long flight, actually.
B: Yeah.
A: Okay. That is so cool. Now I really want to go to Hainan.
B: That would be all the programs have the same beginning point as a platform on the sea.
A: They have the same beginning what beginning platform?
B: A platform on the sea. Beginning from the land.
A: Okay. Yeah.
B: I had a seasickness on it.
A: You got seasick?
B: Yeah.
A: Did you throw up?
B: Throw up?
A: Two?
B: Yeah. Many times.
A: No. Okay, so the way we say two, by the way, we have different ways to say it. We have three different ways to say it. You can say throw up, barf or puke. All of those mean two. Oh my gosh, that's so bad. That is the most uncomfortable feeling. It's very uncomfortable feeling.
B: I miss the land on that platform. I want to finish.
A: No, that's so bad. That's so bad. Okay, so if you take like, a boat, do you feel seasick on the boat?
B: Before, I thought I wouldn't, but from this time.
A: So you didn't do it before? Like, you didn't spend the time?
B: I do it before, but I didn't have that feeling.
A: Okay, but now you feel like since you had the feeling this week that maybe you have it now.
B: Yeah.
A: Oh, no. I don't usually get very seasick. Sometimes if the ocean is moving, like, a lot, then I do feel sick. But I never threw up before. That never happened to me before. It sounds very uncomfortable. Okay, so you guys went diving and surfing and what else?
B: In motorcycle.
A: What kind of motorcycle? Like dirt bike. A dirt bike or like, on the road?
B: On the seat. On the seat. A motorcycle on the seat.
A: We call that a jet ski.
B: Yeah.
A: Like, you sit on it, right? Like this, right? Okay. Yeah, we call that a jet ski.
B: Jet ski.
A: That's so fun. Oh my God. You guys did a lot.
B: Sailboat.
A: Yeah, a sailboat. I'm so jealous. I've never been on a sailboat before.
B: In halfway, our sailboat got wrong.
A: What happened?
B: It couldn't drive. Cause the motor cause motor the motor stopped. The motor didn't stop. It broke, controlled. It can't be driven in a certain direction.
A: Okay, so what did you guys do?
B: We called two jet ski.
A: Oh, no. So you had to get off the sailboat. How many of you guys were there?
B: 10%.
A: Ten of you? Wow, that's a lot. That's a big work trip.
B: Yeah.
A: Did you enjoy it? Was it fun?
B: Yeah, because Hainan was so warm.
A: Was it your first time to Hainan?
B: Oh, yeah, it's my first time.
A: That's really cool. So would you go back?
B: Yeah, I want to go back, especially in the winter.
A: Maybe you can take your girlfriend there. That would be a fun trip.
B: Yeah, there are many Russian people.
A: Oh, really?
B: Yeah.
A: Okay.
B: Many Russian people on the beach, maybe 50% were Russian.
A: That's a lot. So I guess because Hainan is probably one of the closest places that's actually warm for them. Yeah, that makes sense. That's so surprising though. It's really interesting to find out where people from other countries do their vacationing. I didn't realize that. I remember when I was living in South Korea, I was always really surprised because a lot of Koreans will take a vacation in Guam. And Guam is like a part of the United States, but it's closer to Asia than it is to the United States. Like, it's not that far from the and but Americans never go to Guam. Americans always think about Guam as being like a military island because we have a lot of military in know, and so people don't vacation. Like, people never vacation in like I never heard of an American going to Guam for vacation. So when I went to Korea, I was so shocked that people take their vacation there because I never even thought about it because Americans don't do that.
B: Do they need a visa?
A: Do they need what?
B: A visa? Yeah.
A: Americans don't need a visa to go to Guam.
B: I mentioned.
A: Oh, do they need a visa to go to Know? I don't know. Guam probably has different laws than the rest of the United States does because it's like a territory of the US. But I don't really know what those laws are about it. But it seemed like it was pretty easy for them to do it to go. So anyway, it's just kind of interesting, like where people from different countries go. I think Hainan would be so fun. Have you ever been to.
B: Haven'T?
A: No. Have you ever been to Macau?
B: Macau? Another team of my group went to Macau.
A: Oh, really?
B: Yeah, he went with 30,000 and he went back with 50,000.
A: Okay. Makes sense. Yeah. I've heard Macau is kind of like Las Vegas. Okay, well, good for him. That sounds like a good trip. Do you like gambling at all?
B: Yeah, I like it. I will gamble with my friends.
A: You do? If you gamble with your friends, do you guys go out or you do it in your home?
B: Both are okay.
A: Interesting. I don't really do that a lot with my friends. I've done it before, but we don't really do it that often. We don't really do it that often. Yeah, but I think it's really interesting that you took a work trip with your colleagues, because that's also something that I've never done before. Why do you do that? Is it like all just for fun? Or does your company.
B: The company had a funding for works travel.
A: So the company paid for that?
B: Yeah.
A: Really?
B: Yeah. But you can't just get the money you need travel with your colleagues.
A: Oh, right. They won't give you the money. You must do the travel if you want to do it's. Just like free travel, not free money. Okay, that makes sense. That makes sense. I think totally worth it. I think totally worth it. That's really fun. So how many days did you guys go for?
B: Four days.
A: That's really nice. So then you got, like, a four day vacation from work. That's so nice. That's so nice. We just had some time off work because we had the Thanksgiving, and so a lot of people got to take Thursday and Friday off and then the weekend. So it was really fun because I am by my family now and we had a huge Thanksgiving. There were like 47 people from my family yeah. At the giving dinner. It was a lot, but it's really fun. So that's what I've been doing for the past few days, is just like holiday family Thanksgiving stuff. It's fun. It.
